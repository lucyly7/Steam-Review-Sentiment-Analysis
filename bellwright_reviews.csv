Jimbonus,175.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/JimmyReformed/,"June 6, 2024",189,"65 Hours in mostly playing a solo campaign and about 5 hours of the start of duo and here is my take:Good bits:The game has some incredibly deep systems and the refreshing survival risk factor of raiding bandits and relatively difficult combat (especially if outnumbered) rather than the usual hunger, thirst and cold makes the game incredibly fun to play. The game is a grind, there is no getting away from that but incredibly rewarding when you hit key milestones like liberating the first town from ruthless money hungry brigands or build your massive town hall.The storage system and automated villager working service is incredibly intuitive when you get going with it, with a priority system both within the buildings themselves, storage and your villagers it allows you to set limits and priorities to resources and crafting that I haven't seen in similar games.'Bad' bits:These are a few gripes I have, fully understanding the game is in early access as I type this:- As you progress to mid-end game and want to liberate the southern villages you are pretty much forced to move or making significant army outposts to fight off the never ending waves of reclamation brigand parties looking to get the towns back. Most people will have built a flourishing town in the northern region of the game, well away from the brigand headquarters (where the waves spawn from) making it tough and time consuming to March an Army down to defend the southern towns before the brigands reach them. Moving an entire town is an incredibly time consuming. I know that there is a road map for mounts to be added to the game (hopefully) which would make this easier but having the ability to fast travel an army (evening if it was capped or you could build just ONE special travel sign to move troops would be great.- Storage caps - I feel these are a little low, particularly the barn given the time between tier 2 and 3 means you need to build a fair few of them. I appreciate you can mod the game to increase these but many of us would rather not. Co-op:I was pleasantly surprised with the co-op experience of this game, it was incredibly smooth with a shared quest line, renown, gold and storage. You really feel like you are in the journey this game takes you on together. You do have to host the game and locally save it so you will need to play when the original host is online, but honestly this is the kind of game you would both (or all) want to be involved in at every stage. Playing co-op allows you to take on threats you would struggle with in the early game much sooner.Summary:If you enjoy games like medieval dynasty then you will fall in love with this game, I am incredibly impressed given it is in the early stage of early access. Well worth the money.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Certainly, none that are game-breaking.It's far from an easy game to beat with more than enough to do.It's a PC game with a UI and combat system designed for a mouse and keyboard, making it easy to use and intuitive.The back story is simple, believable, and immersive and the quests make sense, are rewarding and you don't have to use YouTube to complete them.Ok, so there are some micro-management issues that need addressing but I'm sure the Devs are working on these. Which means that this truly wonderful game can only get better.One final point. If you didn't know this game was in early access, you wouldn't know by playing it.

Or shoot them with arrows, sometimes- Villager's automatically do things for you, gotta love it     + Crafting, gathering, delivering mats to benches for said crafting- Better food = better HP and Stamina     + Villagers can cook too, don't worry- Better means of getting around the map, you don't just have to walk everywhere- The map is pretty sizeable- Quests are decent, they get more tedious, but nothing unbearable or monotonous     + Different towns tie into each other so it feels meaningful to travel to new towns     +NPCs use AI voices... Listen out for the demon voice- Resource Gather and Craft Cost feels really good, nothing crazy unbalanced or just plain dumb- Devs seem to be active with fixes and changes, we love that too              Cons: - For multiplay, whomever joining must start a game on their own. For some reason if you haven't actually entered the game yet then it wont let you join someone else. Our guess was watching the intro cutscene.- Food burns and villagers don't transfer it to storage so you have to watch it.- Shield Bandits... lol- Arrows will sometimes go straight through a wolf.- Gather rates for mining rocks and ore are god awful if your harvesting isn't leveled, breaking an entire boulder shouldn't produce ONLY 2 stones... even if you are level 1 harvesting.     +Just get a villager to mine- Food spoilage and hunger rates feel a bit quick.- Better crafter clothing ( just cloth/hide, non metal) slows the player down... not a huge fan.TLDR: It's a pretty good game, that looks great, and has been fun to play with my friend so far. For the most part it feels good, and nothing has made me scratch my head yet and question why I was playing. It has quirks and some rough edges, but nothing I wouldn't expect from a new game. I think it's worth every bit of $25, and $30 if you're feeling zesty. People are too overcritical, don't listen to em.

InspektorMagik,89.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hyfrydle/,"May 13, 2024",114,"This game starts out like any other survival game with creating tools to gather wood and rock so you can build a place to live and have food for your belly. Once your setup the quests lead nicely into how the game works. Once you have your first villager the management aspects start to become clear as does an idea of the games depth.Slowly overtime you complete more quests and gradually grow your fledgling settlement into a small village with areas for crafting which can be easily automated to produce what you need to survive and complete more of the quests. This in turn moves you through a deep and rewarding tech tree uncovering new things all the time.The game has a season system and winters can be tough especially as no plants can be harvested so you have to rely on hunting the rabbits, deer, wolves and boar which is not easy early game, but I felt this added to the immersion. something else to mention are the fantastic weather affects with snow falling and covering the ground and some spectacular thunderstorms and blizzards all adding to the realism.The only pressure in the game is the threat of bandit raids which can be lowered in difficulty or turned off if things become too stressful so the player has control of how difficult they want things to be. Once I had a thriving settlement with 10 villagers I really felt like the head of things ordering buildings to be erected, gear to be created and harvesting to be carried out. Each day in game I had plenty of things to do to keep things running and deal with any issues due to shortages etc all the while completing quests and trading with villages in the world.The map is a good size allowing plenty of exploration and in my 70 plus hours of gameplay I have had one crash so stability  seems to be very good.Overall If you enjoy immersive medieval city builders from a first person perspective with plenty of things to discover this game is well worth checking out and support of the game has been very good with frequent updates and bug fixes.

InsidiousRex,68.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/insidiousrex/,"May 29, 2024",107,"The developers are listening, but the community can be downright bull-headed. I had some guy trying to talk down to me in the bug reports section of the discord, trying to tell me that a building bug is fine and that I should just get used to it, and then a developer chimed in and said they're aware of the problem but can't fix it without breaking saves.The game is flawed in some major ways. The early game is very pleasant, but I would warn you that's a trap. Most of the second and third tier resource dependencies are a mess. This is currently being addressed by the devs. The storage system, while it has some control, is still missing some major presets -- and that makes configuring your storage buildings very tedious. Deliveries just ignore that anyway. And even when you get your storages comfortably configured, you'll have to contend with the never-ending problem of playing daddy to your villagers. Where did their weapons go? They unequipped them. Why? Because. But they have a tool slot, so they don't have to have to un-equip their weapons? I dunno. Maybe they unequipped them to have them repaired? Well, they seem fine. Let's use the staging ground? It doesn't work. So I'll order them to interact with the stockpile. Nope. I guess I'll assign them manually? See: step 1. Why can't I have a repair priority and automate repairs? Beats me. Why can't I assign mining and foraging jobs separate from other harvesting tasks? Because. And blacksmithing, weaving, and threshing? All one job. Can we save a loadout? Nope. Can we assign rations and choose which foods villagers will use throughout the day? No. Everything has to be done last minute and at a moment's notice because every few in-game days you're either dealing with a raid or a reclamation party. And if you've still somehow managed to collect tons of wheat, tin, copper, and iron despite all of that, you're still going to need to liberate specific towns just to unlock basic items like a FOOD BAG because they require otherwise unremarkable villagers with a profession tag. Why? Because. It's progression.Unfortunately, this is a game that slowly becomes more and more annoying as you play it. I hope the developers can fix it, but it feels like a vocal part of the community likes it being broken. They think suffering makes them God-tier gamers.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review
Icarius Fallen,63.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197964405424/,"April 28, 2024",934,"The game is what I wanted from mount and blade or medieval dynasty, with one caveat. The devs have abandoned 6 other games previously, three of which were major games (dark and light, of kings and men, and last oasis.) that were fully funded, but never finished.There's also the fact that I've only actually gotten to play about 4 hours out of the 22 hours the game lists itself as being played.. because of constant crashes. Most of my ""playtime"" is spent in loading screens, trying to restart the game.The more annoying things include bandit raids being a bit over-tuned (so you get one almost every day after a certain point, with no way to reduce it), trees not regrowing (so you have to constantly relocate lumber camps to get logs), and hunters that don't particularly do a good job of hunting (sometimes animals don't respawn in places, sometimes the hunters stand and are idle), as well as some REALLY bad AI pathfinding (Your villagers WILL get stuck on your buildings.. often).*Edit* Just updating this because NOW the game crashes after 2 - 10 minutes of play.. which results in staring at the frozen game screen for longer than I actually get to play the game, before ALSO staring at a loading screen for DOUBLE the amount I stare at a frozen game screen.. so four times the amount of time I actually get to play.

RoyHaggerty,150.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/royhaggerty/,"May 22, 2024",44,"A cross between Medieval Dynasty and Mount&Blade:Bannerlord.The beef of this is the village building, rather than the fighting. It's a complex crafting system where everything needs to be made yourself. Enemies can drop ingredients and materials, but never actual finished gear. Likewise merchants, who won't sell complete items, only the materials. So you have to make everything for yourself, and for your villagers. There is a satisfaction in creating a plate-clad army from a handful of peasants dressed in rags, but be aware that it will take a long time to do so. You can craft fast travel for yourself, but not for your companions, so if you want to shift them across the map - which is a BIG map - then you'll need to jog for 5 or 10 real life minutes to get there. To do that, you need to fill up your companions with food, or they'll simply leave you and head home. And food is one of the few elements of this game which moves fast - it can feel very fiddly and frustrating to fill up any medium to large force with enough rations to get to the distant village you want to liberate. Mods help here, and hopefully at some point there'll be steam workshop support for the game.Combat is shanky. Archery works fine, but melee feels a bit basic. NPC pathing is also basic: your villagers will occasionally get stuck on buildings in your settlement, and the most common combat hack is to stand on a rock and shoot arrows into the head of the enemy who can't climb rocks at all, so will patiently wait just below you to be killed (tip: take out enemy archers first, because the higher-level ones shoot laser-guided arrows which will 2-shot you even in decent armour).This is early access, so it's far from finished. I'd expect the final version to have more merchants, for example. But it's very easy on the eye, allows you to build really quite a large village which functions more or less well, and to indulge in some steel-on-steel medieval combat with your carefully nurtured and developed villagers. I found it very satisfying, and quickly knocked up over 100 hours of reasonably relaxed gametime. I recommend it.",Recommended,Early Access Review
Trinun,76.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/trinun/,"May 9, 2024",532,"Having reached the final stage of the game and wiping out all of the bad guy camps, and having built a massive village... I can not recommend this game at this time. Which does break my heart to say.The combat systemThis game is infuriating with it's lack of dynamic mechanics, mostly around it's combat system. While the game aims for realism in some areas, in others such as the combat, it's down right goofy to the point of absurd.1) Horizontal hit box only.- Your character does not bend at the waist, thus even with an overhead-downward chop, you can't hit enemies that are not on a level terrain with you when they are lower than that horizontal hit box. 2) There is no dodge mechanic, no shuffling quickly with your attacks- forwards or back... You just stand there and either guard or swing, or you can slowly move and swing or guard. Which doesn't end well if there are multiple opponents.-The guard system does NOT cost stamina which is the only saving grace to the combat. HOWEVER, it does not save you from being blobbed/murder balled.3) There is NO friendly fire, for you, OR the enemy... That murder ball blob I just mentioned... yeah, the enemy bunches up into a blob just shy of merging with each other, while 1 or 2 enemies will almost always block you, the rest are swinging on you from any direction that you are not blocking, and they WILL swing right through each other and hit you 4) You don't NEED to make any kind of armor for you or for the people you recruit, just shields, and weapons, and that's it. It will always come down to who has the bigger blob, so long as you aggro the enemy archers. That's it, that is the whole meta of this games' combat system. Just blob each other.The Structures.While it is very unfair of me to criticize the lack of certain building aspects and structures in this game as it did just get released, I do feel it necessary to point out, that there are quite a few things that are essential to defending a village or town that are not in this game, along with many other structures you would come to expect to have for simple quality of life and aesthetics for your village. 1) No walls2) No gates3) no lighting up your village at night, inside or outside of any kind.4) no pathways, no roads of any kind.5) NPC villages have all kinds of assets and structures that you cannot build or have in your village.6) You can NOT build with stone. So there are no such structures related to stone at this time.7) Doors are a lie, Doors in this game are only for looks.8) When placing a blueprint down of a soon to be structure, YOU must clear the area first, and excavate it, NOT your NPCs. In addition to this, when you place a build site down (or blueprint or whatever you want to call it) if the ground has a bump in it, it will come right through the floor of the inside and prevent you from walking around, in addition to this, it will allow the entire inside of the building to be effected by the weather. So during winter for instance, the whole inside of your building will be covered in snow.9) Many times when you go to place your BP down on the ground, it can only be placed if it's oriented a certain way. Which is COMPLETELY UNRELATED to the structure not being supported. This is during normal placement, on level ground. So if you have it in your head, that you can build and design this really great clean village all lined up nice, this isn't the game for your then.10) This isn't really a negative as much as it is a disappointment in the game not having this. There are only 2 other games I can think of that are similar, but this game is pretty unique in it's features, which is really saying something. So I had hoped this would be a game where you can build up to be a king and eventually play this crazy long game filled with tedium and hardship so when you did finally accomplish this massive building, you could eventually evolve your village into more and more to the point of you being able to build your own castle. Sadly, this doesn't seem like the case given the fundamentals of this game.1) Changing of the season is extremely strange to the point of it being very silly... Winter comes every 5 days or so, and it last for about 2 or 3 days. If it's not winter, it's something along the lines of spring.2) (arguably a negative- but I'm putting it in neutral because I believe the dev did this on purpose for the release of the game, undershooting it rather than over shooting it following the philosophy that it is better to add to the game, rather than take away.) ""Mining in this game is gross."" You can literally be pickaxing with the best possible pickaxe and be hitting an ore node for over a minute while holding the button down and only get a crude stone rather than ore. Needless to say, the mining in this game is very bad. Now, I will qualify that everything you want or need in this game SHOULD be passively attained through your NPCs, and have them do every thing, but there are too many bugs concerning the NPCs when they go away from your village. So YOU ""HAVE TO"" do the important things your self. Though I can see this being fixed by the dev over time; both the NPCs being bugged out, and the mining.3) The NPC text to voice generated voices are better than not having voices, so ultimately I'm going to compliment the dev on having this in the game as it is something that can be upgraded later on. Good job on this feature. It's neutral however, because they are pretty lifeless voices that can be pretty robotic with emotions and articulation.Um... There is a lot... Basically if I didn't mention it as a negative or a neutral, it's probably borderline positive given the nature of the game, or superbly positive. The graphics, the sound, the attention to detail, the atmosphere, the ambiance, and a BIG Emphasis on the storage system mechanics and the NPC travel paths within the village. You can really go to town on having a well oiled machine because of how wonderful the storage mechanics are in this game, especially with the built in filters you can apply to each storage structure.There is clearly a lot of love put into this game, and it very clearly strives to be the best in the genre.

There's fun to be had, but it's closer to 70/30 Frustration/fun; everything the game does, other games do individual aspects of what it's trying to do here undeniably better. 20ish hours in; Like the game for the feel and the steady progression, feature wise the map is too large which is fine if you weren't fighting limited inventory slots, a fast day/night cycle, or had random encounters to farm (Don't think adding mounts will fix these issues) population management is a little cluttered and underdeveloped(need a way to clear all priorities and do manual assignments to workstations), combat is clunky but functional it does zoning/spacing really well but the swings don't feel like they have much gravity/impact, basically feels like the game is stuck in 2014 in terms of character movement & combat.Crafting could use a revisit, it's not fun to try to use a workbench to build an item yourself and stare inside a static menu interface for 1min 50secs straight to make a shirt or a minute to make a single tool(you can have the AI do it, but it feels like a punishment rather than a shortcut when you craft stuff yourself);  some of the material requirements don't make sense like a Seax (1h sword) doesnt require any metals to build, but it required tin for the tech unlock. The material requirements don't really have corresponding metrics either, like 5 pieces of wood makes 1 simple axe but also is enough wood for half a building, or that 1 log = 5 wood, meaning that 1 log after processing only makes 1 axe? Seems like every item you craft is made of a recipe of 3 ingredients, and 90% of them ask for 5-6 wood, 3-5 stone, and random metal/cloth. Not a big problem, but you'll be sitting there for nearly 2 mins at a work bench wondering why you needed stone and wood for a bronze sword..Personal inventory management is fine, but settlement storage is pretty counter intuitive, with the way food spoils  and farming works early on, it's too easy to over produce and end up cluttering all of your storage sites if you don't program them in advance.Could look past all that and enjoy what it is and what it might become, if it wasn't for how horribly optimized and unstable the game runs. Boot up time is wild, loading screens are painful, hard stops/stutters when trying to navigate menus too fast the crashes are frequent but random as all hell. Out of 24ish hours of playtime, honestly about 4 hours of that was loading/crashing just do the same exact thing on the next load in and have it work fine.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

I know the hardcore fanbase will hate me for this, but for us good ol' casual players, this is the truth.So the game in it's current state is very good, and it will definitely be a great game in some time.But there are some key critical things the developers need to address, which makes this game unplayable usually after 10-13 hours.For instance trees do not regrow. Timber is one of themost important resource in the game, and it is finite.Young trees have a chance to regrow after a year, but it seems only 20-30% of them do regrow after playing 28 in game days. This is too slow, as wood also becomes a scarce resource after a while.The grind is insane, and you need to walk for about 80% of the time your first 10 hours, since the resources are so spread, and you have a very limited inventory. At the start you can only carry 2 timber for instance, and when you have upgraded to a bag, you can carry three. Most structures need 10 timber, let alone 20 wood, 20 flax, and other resources as well.The AI is also bare, struggling with eating food, even though you might have a ton of food spread across your village.When the NPC's are hungry, they stop working, and instead go out foraging after food. If it's winter, you have 7 days where they go across the map to find food, which makes the NPC very inefficent.The AI voicing in this game is terrible, and breaks the feel of the game straight away, but that is not really game breaking per say.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

I'm 52 hours in and barely have explored probably 15-20% of the map.  It doesn't hold your hand, but for the most part uses common sense to figure things out, which I like.Things that need fixing:-I want to hover over a resource in any menu if it's shown and know how much of it I have at any given time-Needs a search on buildings, storage, etc to see what you want to quickly.  Too much scrolling.-Bow mechanics need work-Combat as a whole needs work-Food needs to not spoil so fast, when you create a squad they need to pick the best food prior to coming to your side, any trip with your viliage to take down a camp that isn't right by your camp, just has your people fall back to base because they are hungry.  Big problem.-Not sure if there is a way, but I can't find a way to assign workers to focus on building a specific building rather than their other tasks.  Seems like it's whenever they feel like.-Need an overall ""moral"" of the settlement, not this individual nonsense you have little to no control over.But it's EA, understandable issues.  Very enjoyable so can't complain much.  Had 2 crashes in 52 hours of play.  I run a 4080 mobile GPU and runs well past 60fps all the time, no issues.

You can set them to be a companion for fights, or you can set them up to go gather resources or build stuff at your base, lots of options when it comes to how you control you villagers.I also love how you start off with nothing and have to go out there and get villagers for your village. I have only played Solo so far and its been a blast, I bet it is good fun in coop to with a friend!, but I have not tried it yet myself.The combat needs a little work, performance isn't to bad but can be improved and needs more polish but whats here atm is a good amount of fun for me and I can see myself playing a bunch of this.Excited to see what gets added to the game to, as the baseline here is pretty awesome so far. Just keep adding more cool things to the game. I would love boats (I heard Mounts are coming), but a small boat or Canoe with fishing would be great :)Better than I was expecting for day 1 of Early Access tbh!Only played about 5 hours but the time spent on the game so far has been pretty fun and somewhat relaxing, check it out!Lastly, it is also great to see the devs already have 3 updates put out for this game on Day 1 and another update the next morning after the game came out, hope they keep up the updates because this is a great start! :)As far as the Voice work goes, yes it is AI placeholder until later in development when there will be human voice actors. I have no progblem with this while its in Early Access as a placeholder that will be replaced late. Not a big deal to me personally but worth a mention. Many games user store assets or placeholder stuff until later on in development, as long as it gets replaced later I don't mind, lets them focus on gameplay and polish early on.",Recommended,Early Access Review

You can control how you strike ie. over head, sideways from right or from left.For this reason I know this game to be unique and not just another copy from its genre.Graphics are crisp.I also noticed bandit camps with burley angry men in them...lolYou can turn Raids on or off and I have to say this option is something i really like in games. It allows you to build rather then constantly be bombarded having to repair rather than build, because in some games the raids can be over whelming and too much.I will update my review as I log in more hours.I do recommend this game and the price seems very fair.not seeing a lot of bugs which some companies have wrong about early access, they release a game into early access full of bugs that anyone can see, most likely back logged bugs that just have not yet been addressed. What they must realise is that we are paying for these games and that's not our job to point out long lists of bugs they already know about and have just not yet fixed.Our job is to point out bugs play testers have not been able to find and help build the game the way the community likes to play.Bellwright is play ready without a long list of simple bugs.Also has a very nice and lengthy tech tree, which i really like.Have Fun!!

You get chests for the settlement that WILL have stacking, and thus, plenty of room of resources.2) sprint stamina, yes it's a little short in the beginning, but when you have eaten food and progressed in the game a bit, it's a non-issue and feels like just about any other game with the stamina mechanic in it.There have been 3 patches so far today, which indicates the devs are quite active on addressing issue, which is good.Overall, I'd give it a 75-80 out of 100.",Recommended,Early Access Review
Joew,12.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/joewalabel/,"April 26, 2024",559,"The team have strategy to announce and hype their games.After they releases EA and they updates till the players starts to complain, suggestions and report bugs.After this team loses patience and starts blocking and insulting the players that make suggestions.After when it came the time they do not get more money, they just abandon the game and announce their new scam.You can see their last and abandoned project Last Oasis. They releases one good game, but after some time they changed completely the game: change combat system, loot system, how you learn and build the things, REMOVED MANY MAPS AND VEHICLES (walkers) and insults players so this cause the Last Oasis death all by developers fault and very bad decisions.Just for that i do not recommend this game and no other from those developers.I lost the thrush on them, cause ALL OTHERS PROJECTS WERE ABANDONED UNFINISHED.So, if u hear it's Early Access, the things will be better after some time, it is a lie. For all others project from this team, all ended badly.Well, if you do not care and u're a dreamer, lets talk about THIS SPECIFIC BAD GAME:- It IS NOT A SURVIVAL game. It do not have hunger, thirsty and tireless systems. You have many food to eat, but they are not for satisfy ur hunger or thirsty. All foods are to recover your health, stam and gives hp and recovery bonus. So, it is like all OLD games, you have the items to recover and gain bonus, not to survive. Btw, this game DO NOT HAVE HAVE NEITHER ONE SURVIVAL SYSTEM. So if u are like me that loves survival, this game IS NOT FOR YOU.You don't suffer from the temperature, so all seasons pf the game are ONLY VISUALS. You do not fell cold on winter, you do not need winter clothes. The same to warm temperature. You do not be more thirsty on higher temperatures. Btw, it do not have thirsty system so u do not have to drink nothing.- The combat system is very bad and poorly made. Well, it is THE WORSE COMBAT system I've saw on all my life. I don't know if it's because the game isn't optimized but i really can't enjoy the combat. Well, not only enjoy I REALLY HATED the combat. AI is very stupid too. The ONLY thing they do are go direct to you after target you. They don't have any strategy, they don't cover, the only thing they do is run straight to you. Well, this system is worst than old games from 20 years ago.- The hunting is very bad too. You have to use your bow to hunt but the only thing the deers and bunnies do is target you from a very high distance and runs like a F1 car to the opposite of your direction til they disappear from your sight. And they are very stupid, they stuck on everything. They do not trace any route, they stuck on rocks, mountains, fall on rivers and so on.- You have to contract NPCs to work at your base or to follow you as a companion on your journeys. But again, they are stupid and they are broken too. Idw what the fu** the npcs always get items from one chest and try place on the stock pile. If the stock pile is already full, the NPCs DROPS ALL ITEMS THEY TOOK FROM OTHERS CHEST ON GROUND.So, the only thing I think that would be interesting is unacceptable. It do not work and made me very angry a lot of times.So, what you have:- Build: terrible, too bad. You can't build freely. You have to build pre made blueprints.- Combat: Terrible, lagged, not fluid, not fun, - Village Manager: terrible. The workers AI are too stupid. Well, it just DO NOT HAVE ANY AI.- Quests: terrible. All quests is one way. You do not have choice to decide how you want do the quests. If you have to hunt some animal to get pelt, for example, the only final for the quest is you gives the pelt. You can not say to the npc you will not give the pelt and loses renown. So, it is the same from 20+ years ago. Pick the quest on one npc, do the tasks, finish the quest at the same npc you got. So, poorly made, exhausting, boring. All the time you have just to go to one part of the map, do something, came back. And that's all. You do not have anything more to do.- Mounts, vehicles: nonexistent. You can't mount a horse well there are no HORSE at all. A medieval age that horses don't exits. A very bad joke, right? You do not have wagons to transport itens. You only have your body to transport.You can craft one bag that gives you a little more slots but, after equip the bag, your character do not change. You do not see the bag equipped.  Again, poorly made this game. What is the difficult to put one bag at ur back?After some hours (3 or more) you have nothing more to do on the game, just repeat and repeat the same things. It is very grinding. For stupid people that have to make the same things again and again =(So you will loose a lot of time playing just to conquest one little reward.And the final warning and one of the most important:Do not believe on videos at youtube, Twitch and all others video/streamming medias. Those scam developers sponsors some yt/streamers to talk GOOD about the game. So, for sure you can't thurst, Those yt/stremmers are like the developer's team's bit****.

DrHardware,16.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057181859/,"April 23, 2024",366,"Very disappointed with the current state of the game thus far.As workers, they'll cook your food, but leave it to burn instead of taking it and putting it in storage..never mind that if the campfire has no wood, it'll still burn the food.If you have a campfire / Bloomery, but you're not cooking or smelting anything, your workers will still stock them with firewood, just to burn for fun.Workers won't collect from rabbit traps - the meat will just rot within minutes if you don't get it yourself, and forget about having them automatically re-baited.Early game, just about all combat requires companions with you, its VERY rare / difficult to get 1-on-1 fights with the mobs (except maybe the wolves).  I expect later game to be worse.Food rots far too fast to be worth gathering or cooking, except for popping a berry and a mushroom in your mouth before running across the map.  and if you don't feed your companions... they won't follow you.   To make it worse, lets have a couple of 'winter days' each week which means food is not available in the wild.   I ASSUME these problems abate a bit once farming and more complex cooking is available.thus far it appears that YOU can't do any research - it has to be worker/s.  even a research book doesn't seem to teach you how - you need the skill before it can be improved.  My only thought here is its meant to force players to get used to using workers for such tasks....

I had so much fun that I wished I didn't have work the next day, so I could dive back in for another long session.Since the game is still in early access, my review is mainly for the developers. Let me break down what I liked:The sound and audio were really nice. Sometimes my character made too much noise during combat or when chopping a tree, which was kinda funny. I mean, I could put up a whole bed frame without making a peep!Now, onto the graphics – they were great! I know you might want more details, but honestly, they were good enough to keep me engaged, and they ran smoothly on my 3-year-old laptop.Character creation was a bit limited though. The devs should definitely work on that. Many videos I watched before buying the game also mentioned this. Just adding more hairdos, face options, skin colors, eye colors – you know, the basics. You don't have to go all out like Black Desert, just a bit more variety would be nice.Crafting and construction were super easy and fun. I loved gathering materials and building stuff. The point-and-click building system was really satisfying and straightforward.The inventory was a bit small, and it would be better if items were all in one box instead of scattered around. Like, if I collect sage, all the sage should go into one box, not spread out across multiple empty ones.Combat and looting were both easy to handle, no issues there.Now, about the controller – I could walk around with it, but I couldn't do other stuff. I hope they add more controller support as the game gets better.That's about all I can think of for now. If anything else comes to mind, I'll add it later.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Pittsburgh Pirates Hat,214.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pittsburghpirateshat/,"May 19, 2024",16,"This game is not perfect by any means but it is what I was expecting from myth of empires, a city builder game where you control a customizable character who recruits NPCs with skills to build a town together. Plus there is some warfare along the way so you really feel like you’re going on a journey from a nobody to a hero carving out your own destiny and your own town along the way. I absolutely applaud the devs of this game for being extremely proactive about fixing game breaking bugs and taking into account things players have already done and avoiding potential save breaking. Whoever the devs of this game are just for that deserve to rule the gaming industry and make decisions for every other studio. This game doesn’t hold your hand or offer much of a tutorial and while that usually is a bad thing, the devs of this game made it feel like you’re learning through the gameplay without help. You’re encouraged to devise your own strategies and figure things out yourself, you have to think and you don’t have to do it in a way that is overly hard. The perfect balance between challenging and handholding. They even added a special button to unstuck the player if they’re trapped somewhere. Do you have any idea how many other games could use that? The devs care about technical issues and made a single player focused fun game which is just a godsend, a crack through the clouds, in a gaming industry so polluted by the twin scourges of greed and Warhammer. Now for the negatives, while the devs definitely put time and effort into fixing the technical issues, they certainly didn’t put anything into the voice acting. The voice acting sounds like AI generated voices or like they recorded the voice lines in a literal echo chamber with an old microphone. The lag is obscene, some of the worst lag I’ve ever seen. There are still some technical bugs I’ve found especially regarding research like  NPCs I specifically hired for research not researching despite setting that to be their priority and having all the materials. Plus NPCs taking raw materials I specifically put into the production machine things back to storage and when I put a hammer in their hands I expect them to build not put it back. That should be fixed too but given the devs care about this kind of stuff I think they’ll fix it soon. Seriously to give you an idea of how bad the lag is and how much I want the devs to fix it, the lag and power consumption of this game is so bad that it actually caused the breaker for the outlets in my apartment to fail twice! That is the biggest technical thing that needs fixing.Give this game a chance. On a side note this also feels like an actual original fantasy world, no overly supernatural/mythological crap and nothing overly unrealistic. Overall a solid 8 out of 10 with the only points deduction being for the lag, voice acting, and remaining bugs. The latter of which I really hope the devs fix.

Little bit later i decided to give it a last try and damn, i was suprised on how solid it actually is.Obviously it has all the common early access issues like the performance being not optimal, animations looking clunky and of course a few bugs, tho i haven't experienced a game breaking one yet.On the other side Bellwright feels like Medieval Dynasty just more focused on combat, arms and armour. (The combat could obviously be improved but it's not a big issue as of now) It has the same slow but relaxing progress which i personally really enjoy. The villager management is also satisfying and very similar to games like Rimworld or Going Medieval. The world itself is huge with a few villages here and there and certainly some bandit camps/outposts. To be fair the game is more of a running simulator as of now but hopefully that's going to change soon when they add horses.I am really enjoying the game and i feel like most people which liked Medieval Dynasty or similar games will like it aswell, tho i wouldn't recommend it for everyone.In the end it's your decision, either you buy it and take the risk of a possible abandoned game and ""lose"" your money or you simply don't buy it and check back in a year or so.",Recommended,Early Access Review

I heard negative opinions on this company based on their previous, abandoned games. They may be right, but I review this particular game and don't judge them by their past creations. And this game is a masterpiece. Take a look at the number of hours I played at the moment of writing this review. And I literally can't stop. The game is full of content, even though it is still in early access. Every now and then I am under an impression that every piece and every relation in this game have been thoroughly well thought of. Yes, there are bugs, some are annoying, but this is early access. Even though the game is very playable and if you figure out how to workaround those bugs, you feel even more satisfied. One such example was NPCs dropping their weapons. I had to equip them before every battle. I decided to build a few shacks with private chests to keep weapons there (so they don't steal them) and to equip them before battle, but the Devs applied a patch that introduced additional slot for a tool, which resulted in NPCs not dropping their weapons anymore. They do listen to players' feedback. The game merges some best elements and ideas from different other, similar games, which make it unique. And I don't have to mention about great graphics and pleasant, slavic ambient background music, varying depending on what you do.

Combat:The combat is just an iteration / derivative of Last Oasis combat.  Yes it is improved a little.   But still doesn't feel good, and is cumbersome. UI: Is good enough, but the game seems to be stuck in 1920x1080 with upscaling.    Why?    I even tried to force 2560x1440 in the .ini files, but the game keeps forcing itself back to 1920x1080 with upscaling.Since this is a story driven game, and you need to achieve goals, they road to get to those goals should be loose recommended you follow type of thing.   But in practice it is not.   You are left to figure it out on your own, and are easily able to tech too high and out-advance what your village is able to sustain.   There should be a hard cap lock on how far into  a tech tree you can go without the appropriate number of villagers to support.Colony / Sim / Villager management is ok.

They keep putting weapos and armor away that I want them to retain.Adult tree's do not respawn, and this *NEEDS* to be fixed.Building:  Not a fan of the building system, I can see where they want to go with it.  But if you are going to implement a progressive building system, then make it look logical, don't have half a hut standing in the air where it would normally collapse.   Make the building pieces follow convention.    Foundations, cross members, and support structures first,  Then walls, wall coverings with the roof being last.   IE: Work from the ground up.   Try to find something that represents / guides you to the next spot to build as something other than a white circle/dot floating in the air.

You need it for most starting buildings an items, so out of the first 7 in-game days which lead up to winter when everything dies instantly and you can't find plants anymore you're spending about 5 days gathering flax and the rest two running. Crafting has two modes: ""stare at the screen while a circle moves for half a minute"" and get the villagers to do it instead.Research has one mode: get the villagers to do it. Which is pretty annoying when they decide to ignore it and run to the other side of the map to put down a trap for whatever reason.Inventory management isn't most sensible either. Yes I know I can only carry a certain amount of things, and the game tries to be realistic, but come on... A log the size of a person takes up 9 inventory spaces and so does 9 pieces of straw sized plants. You literally see the size of what you pick up, don't you dare tell me that you can't put 300 of those flax plants into a side-bag sized anything (it weights practically nothing too).Actually building buildings is another thing. This game uses small white dots to show interactable things, both plants, loot, aaand dozens of spots around the in production buildings that you have to click one-by-one to place sticks on top of each other. Yeah this is literally what a number of other games do, but this time you can barely see where you should click next, because they are not always visible from all angles and in certain light conditions you can't even see them at all.Next up: Combat. Sluggish and annoying. Before that guy in the reviews start at it, I'm good in it, but it's still a bad experience. The only decently made part of combat is the bow.Nothing personal to the voice actors, but that part also sounds horrible, like listening to a twitch streamer (I mean the audio setup right now.) Also whoever thought of putting random fly noises in the game that just comes up sometimes, needs to be closed in a room with a fly, with blindfolds on...You can look at this game from two angles:- A more tedious Medieval Dynasty with more micromanagement.- Manor Lords but third person rpg instead of strategy.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

Resource balancing needs a lot of work, as you are always running out of crucial resources and you are never quite able to get a self-sustaining engine running with settlers because the system always breaks, they run out of food, wood, or whatever and the whole thing collapses immediately.Combat is quite terrible...swinging is laggy and feels like you are fighting underwater. Enemies are generally overpowered in melee, but have no fear you can exploit them by simply standing on a rock and plinking them with a bow. Lastly is the inventory management jenga game they have given us. It's terrible, and you will spend almost as much time juggling resources and tools as you do trying to figure out why your villager won't smelt bronze. In fact you'll spend so much time on those tasks you'll realize you aren't having fun or even playing the actual game, but rather just trying to troubleshoot a rudimentary engine. I'm eager to check back in a year to see if they have given us actual content vs a chore, until then back into the pile of survival games that were their own worst enemy.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review
FerimerGamingTTV,50.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ferimer/,"May 1, 2024",13,"I rarely leave reviews for games and that is because I am too busy playing them and having fun at what the game has to offer. I am thoroughly enjoying this game. If you're like me and read reviews to get an idea of what the player base is enjoying and not at least read a review from someone that has more than 20 hours played of this game because I can tell you right now the 25.4 hours (at time of this review) I have put into the game thus far and haven't even began to scratch the surface. I am not rushing through or watching guides or ""Things i wish I knew"" videos because I want to explore and enjoy and find out for myself and you should too if you choose to pick this game up. I will say this its an early access game so keep that in mind when buying this game or looking to buy it. With that said I will say it is one of the better EA games I have played. It has elements of Valheim and Medieval Dynasty but also has its own spin on certain mechanics. Combat I laugh at people complaining about it, Clearly they haven't ever played Mount and Blade and it shows, the combat is almost identical. You aren't going to do a ton of damage hitting someone with your hilt. You are going to block hits if you angle your weapon their way. You are not going to be able to take on 3 bandits or 3 of anything by yourself. Take a companion with you. 25 hours in I was able to build a settlement with about 6 settlers plus myself that is fully self sufficient and I can focus on what I want to do. Levelling is like Bethesda type games where you have to use the skill in order to gain exp to level up. SAVE YOUR BOOKS and read them but make sure they finish before you die or you lose that book progress. That is the easiest and fastest way to level up and get better. Don't listen to people going on about how it all sucks and you cant hit anything or blah blah blah. Of course you can't you need to learn how and that is the levelling system here as you get better at combat it becomes way easier and you will be able to take on 3 Bandits if you know how to of course. It can be done but 3+ bring a companion with you and use a Bow and Arrow its more effective than trying to melee if you don't feel confident in your ability. There is room for improvement for sure and I cannot wait to see what that will look like but I will say this 25 hours in and I have only reached tier 2. Easily a 200 + hour game. Which is awesome in this day and age when a 40-60 hour game gets boring. Oh tip - Save your straps and get to tier 2 as fast as possible then do unlocks. That is all I will say.

Snoring Bush,20.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/snoringBush/,"May 23, 2024",16,"It pains me to give Bellwright a negative review, but I want to highlight some aspects of the game that might be crucial for potential buyers to consider before making a purchase.Firstly, many negative reviews mention issues such as trees being a finite resource, bandits frequently killing players, and the perceived difficulty in reaching tier 3 building. While trees can indeed become a finite resource, and bandits are challenging at the beginning as you learn the combat system, achieving tier 3 isn't as hard as it seems. Here are some tips to improve your experience: Take time to scout for an optimal location for your settlement. Being close to key locations like Padstow for carpenters and Farnsworth for easy-to-recruit laborers can significantly aid your progress. Consider the availability of resources such as trees, ore, mud, forageables, and hunting grounds. Yes, the game can feel like a grind at times, but it's entirely possible to reach tier 3 and develop a large settlement if you stay focused on your objectives. Many players struggle because they look for settlers or resources in less optimal locations. Managing your settlers effectively is crucial. Ensure they always have work to do, provide them with necessary tools like carpenter hammers, and assign them to maintain a steady supply of resources. This keeps your settlement running smoothly while you handle other tasks. Common bugs like malfunctioning bloomery, campfire, or drying rack can be resolved by tearing down and rebuilding the structures. Sometimes, a game restart also helps. Regularly saving your progress is essential, especially since NPCs can get stuck in walls, necessitating a reload.However, there are significant downsides: As your settlement grows, the game's optimization issues become more apparent, leading to frequent crashes. I currently run a settlement with over 50 people and tier 3 crafting, but the instability is frustrating. By the time you build a formidable army and acquire cool gear, it feels like the game's content is nearly exhausted. This, combined with the frequent crashes and bugs, diminishes the enjoyment.One major improvement that could enhance the game is the implementation of frustum culling and occlusion culling to optimize rendering. This would significantly improve performance by only rendering what the player sees.Despite these issues, Bellwright is still in early access, and I remain hopeful for its future. The game has immense potential, and with further development, it could become something truly special. For now, due to the crashes, bugs, and lack of late-game content, I have to give it a thumbs down. Additionally, I hope the developers consider increasing the player limit beyond four.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

Like, telling an NPC to stop your delivery and come do that research NOW.3) Alcohol, wine, beer, etc. During medieval time, these were mostly safer than drinking water so...4) A mud ""mixer"".

Framed for the heinous crime of regicide, he narrowly escaped the clutches of the Crown's executioners. For years, he wandered the shadows, a fugitive in his own land, surviving on wits and guile.But fate has a peculiar way of nudging the course of events. One moonless night, while evading yet another attempt on his life, Alaric stumbled upon a parchment, stained with blood and sealed with the insignia of the Sovereign's Guard. It was a contract, detailing the assassination of the Prince. Questions surged like a raging river in his mind. Who orchestrated this treachery? Was his framing merely a pawn in a larger game of power?Determined to unearth the truth and seek justice, Alaric embarked on a perilous journey back to the kingdom, the very heart of the darkness that consumed his life. Along the way, he encountered remnants of a once-proud resistance, oppressed villagers yearning for liberation, and exiles like himself, stripped of their dignity and rights.With each step, Alaric not only reclaimed slivers of his lost past but also forged bonds with those who shared his vision of a free kingdom. Together, they established hidden settlements, offering sanctuary to the downtrodden and disillusioned. They trained in the art of warfare, honing their skills to challenge the Crown's iron grip.As Alaric delved deeper into the secrets of his lineage, he uncovered a legacy intertwined with the very fabric of the kingdom's history. His ancestors, revered guardians of justice, had been silenced by the same darkness that now threatened to consume the realm.With newfound resolve and a growing army at his back, Alaric led the charge against the Sovereign's forces. Battles raged across the countryside, each victory fueling the flames of rebellion. Villages once cowed into submission now rallied to his cause, offering their resources and manpower.But the path to liberation was fraught with peril. The Crown, sensing the threat to its dominance, unleashed its most fearsome weapons: betrayal and deception. Alaric and his comrades faced assassins, traitors, and the machinations of corrupt nobles at every turn.Yet through courage, cunning, and unwavering determination, they pressed on. They seized key strongholds, liberated towns, and inspired hope in the hearts of the oppressed. And as the tide of battle turned in their favor, the bells of freedom tolled once more, echoing across the land.In the final confrontation beneath the shadow of the Citadel, Alaric faced the Sovereign, a tyrant whose reign of terror had come to an end. With the truth laid bare for all to see, the people rose up as one, casting off the chains of oppression.And as the kingdom emerged from the darkness, bathed in the light of a new dawn, Alaric stood as a beacon of hope, the hero of his people, his name etched into the annals of history as the one who dared to defy the might of kings and usher in an age of freedom and justice.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Rage,7.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rage_youtube/,"June 29, 2024",13,"As of writing this, 6/30, I cannot recommend this game at full price, or even at 10% discount. Contrary to the mostly positive reviews right now, the game is clunky and somewhat inaccessible to play, in the way that controls and intuitive menu interactions are really funky.Combat is exceptionally clunky and outright infuriating to play with, as it's just basically completely unbalanced to the point the only way to even get close to winning is using bow and arrow, but even then it sometimes isn't even enough. The NPCs and enemies stack on top of you, all swinging simultaneously and you essentially can't outrun them, or block against them all without taking some hits. And with how easy it is to die in this game, those ""battles"" can end insanely quick. Trying to combat this with companions also leads to your companions being numb skull heads and running straight into the enemy swings and basically dying in only a matter of a minute. Armor doesn't seem to make a difference, and using improved weapons doesn't really even matter that much. Also, it seemingly has no dedicated 1P mode you can use, which is a huge bummer as the combat is similar to Chivalry 2. If there was a 1P mode, combat would be a lot more intuitive.The settlement interactions and settler management can tend to be a bit much and can lead to micromanaging your settlers and eventually armies. At some point the settlers should just be fully autonomous so you're not micromanaging each one. Tasks are also very blunt and straight-forward, I.E. fetch this for me, bring me these resources, etc.. Maybe expand on the diversity for questing and avoid fetch quests, especially for villages that have their own thriving systems and settlers that can do this for them. It just doesn't make sense to be fetching resources and gear for villages that you're not a part of or don't want to be a part of.I will say however, the atmosphere, idea and concept are a great bonus to the game. It genuinely feels like a fairly immersive medieval game. There's not much survival, in the sense you don't need to worry about hunger or thirst, though you can consume food but it's just basically Valheim buffs, like increased health and stamina. Settlers on the other hand do require food, apparently, but the player does not. Overall, the game has a good view and it's got an ideal path set ahead but the developers need to consider fixing these fundamental flaws before expanding the game more. Give the game maybe another 5-6 months and then check it out on a discount. I just hope the devs see through these and get things done.

It's a nice combination between survival, city (settlement) planning and all set in the time period it is and I'm sold. Some of the negatives I've seen mentioned does not seem like problems for me. Lack of stamina? Eat multiple foods, you have decent stamina. Can't stack items in your inventory? Not a problem. No item has weight, so inventory size is a perfectly ok way to limit inventory abuse.

After the devs have been banging out daily updates - I have changed my reservations regarding past abandoned projects. It is clear that the devs are passionate and responsible with this title, and it is paying off. Even if they all fall down a hole tomorrow - I think there is more than enough here to justify the asking price. It has certainly sucked me in, and I am having great fun - to the point that I am not playing anything else. So, it now gets my solid 100% gold seal approval (which is currently worth five quid on the black market).  (old outdated review below)Well - I swore I was not going to get this game until I was sure it would not be abandoned before finished. Normally it is a big pass for me if the developer has abandoned just one game in the past. However, Bellwright was just the game I needed at this particular time, so I thought 'ferk it', and put the cash down. I really do hope this game get finished, as it turns out *to be* just the game I need at this time. I am encouraged and gaining confidence by the daily amount of work being put into it. I pay little or no attention to reviews anymore, as most of them are people with a bellyache, who play for 10 minutes then post 'I hate this game', then go off to kick a lamppost. So, after quiet a few hours, gotta say, I am chillin' back and really enjoying my time with it. For me, it runs smoothly (even if my PC sound like a helicopter), graphics are good, gameplay loop is engaging, and the game has quite a few ideas that surprised me (in a nice way). So far - loving my time with the game. If you are into the whole medieval crafting thing (and - it seems - who isn't?). I think this game is certainly worth your time. Get it, play it for 2 hours, and you will know if it is for you. Of course, there is always a gamble with a developer who has abandoned games in the past, but I really think they are onto a good thing with this game.

Aled...,125.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AledLeww/,"May 17, 2024",6,"I'm pretty obsessed with this game and even more obsessed with what it could become. The premise of it is brilliant, forming your own medieval village from nothing and starting your own merry band of rebels to take on a corrupt monarch and her thugs.. *Chefs Kiss*The map is beautiful, the audio gives it a perfect ambience of a wild countryside.It's so frustrating how a truly fantastic game is a hairs breadth away, don't get me wrong it's a great game and so time consuming for those that like this type of thing. But there's a lot of parts to the game that feel very crude or basic.While the design of the buildings is spot on and a built up village looks incredible, the building system is fist-clenching levels of annoying, invisible objects blocking buildings, *slight* inclines that result in the structure ""Not being fully supported"".. This gets worse at tier 3 when the buildings are much bigger. There's painfully few spots I've come across that have both the ideal flat land and are central on the map.Combat to me is actually not too bad, I've put 1000+ hours into Bannerlord which uses the basically the same system, all be it a more polished version. It could do with some improvement in terms of hit boxes for blocking without a shield I seem to get hit quite frequently when correctly blocking horizontal slashes. Shields need WAY more hit points, they break so frequently I can't be bothered to use them, even tier 3. The AI needs some time spent on it, It's just really inefficient at prioritisation and pathing. BUT it's not awful, micromanagement is key.. they do eventually get on with things once they clear the queue of extra stuff you've told to them to do like building and one-off crafts, if you're an organised person you can set up individual NPCs to do specific tasks they are better skilled at which helps a lot. The more effort you put into your villagers jobs/tasks the more you'll get out of them.My one major gripe with the game is travel/movement. The map isn't tremendous in size, but travelling any sort of distance feels like a huge chore with the movement speed and no way of traversing quicker like horses etc. This is alleviated by the fact you can build your own fast travel signs nearly anywhere you wish as long as it's near a road and not within I think 100 meters of a neutral village. Think I've place near 30 of them already.It's gotten to the point where I run around without armour to increase my movement speed, only putting my stuff back on for fighting.

Johnny Handsome,37.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970351255/,"May 2, 2024",9,"As somebody who played Medieval Dynasty for many hours and gave it a thumbs down, because to me it's just a decoration simulator, i would like to give a review on this game here too. From games i like, i would say that i am their target group in terms of content and gameplay.First of all, the game complexity is pretty low, because the food basically buffs your stats, but you don't have to consume it to survive. The buildings you can build provide several Tiers of Items you can build, which is pretty straight forward and linear in progression, but doesn't add any complexity in terms of micromanagement or whatever into the game. The amount of ressources and items is also easily manageable, especially because the whole system is pretty linear and therefore you don't get to a point where you get flooded by a crazy amount of new items, buildings or whatever.You can go into towns, build trust with doing quests and then get people to join your settlement, for which you have to build a house for them and then you can use them as your workers, guards for the settlement or companions, which makes them run with you and take your orders (stay, attack and such). You need the guards because bandits are patrolling the whole map and there are bandit camps all across the map which you can attack and loot with your people from the settlement. To do this you have to build gear for them, which has also different quality levels, armor, strength requirements and such, which is pretty basic for a role playing game.Every building you can build in this game has a purpose, meaning that you have to build this building to craft certain things. What is kind of weird is that you have to build buildings for your workers to gather things, which isn't true for you. So you can just go out and gather wood, but your workers need a building to do this, which doesn't make much sense from a design choice, but that's just my opinion.The whole map is pretty huge with many points of interest, some towns you can build trust with (do quests) to then get their people to join you too, many bandit camps from Tier 1 to Tier 3 difficulty and and overall well designed look. I never felt like i have to go somewhere, besides some spots where you have certain ressources, but the map doesn't force you to explore it, at least not to the point to which i played.There are two very big issues in this game, from which one is just bad implementation and the other is a very poor design choice. Let's start with the design issue.You can't make your workers do specific things, instead you set a priority for every worker to do certain things. For instance, you can tell a worker to have priority 1 in research, priority 2 in cooking and so on. You can also set every priority to one number, there is no limit to it. The main issue is that nowhere does the game explain to you what those priorities really mean from an implementation point of view. So you set the priority and ... well assume whatever, because it isn't explained what those actually mean.I personally assumed that a priority means that when the current task is done and the next task is on a higher prioritised level, then the AI would do this one instead of another. So if i tell my AI that research is 1 and cooking is 2, then whenever there is something to research it would prioritize the research task over the cooking task. That's not what happens, which might either be a bug or the worst implementation based on design i have ever seen.Let me give you an example and the reason i quit this game today. I am on Tier 2 with my buildings, which means that research is also taking quite some time and also food as ressources. Food is consumed by your workers, because they have to eat or otherwise they will leave you or whatever happens (never had that case, so it's just a theory). So when you put food as a ressource into your research station, then those idiots will consume it. You can't prevent them from doing it except for you standing in front of it and handing food towards any AI coming at the station with a ""hungry"" symbol over their head, to prevent them from taking the food out of the research station. I also never found an option to make you AI not take anything FROM the building, but only put stuff INTO the building. Ok, so there is a solution for this issue, but the main part comes with the combination of the stupid AI priority system. So the whole priority stuff does whatever, which means that you can have several people with research on priority 1, everything else with a lower priority, the research building itself set to priority 1 and everything else on a lower priority level, assuming that IF there is SOMETHING to research it would be researched based on the highest priority and every other task would be done afterwards. But that is not what happens, the AI won't research for several ingame days and real time hours. I even canceled the research, set another thing to get researched which worked, then get to the first thing i wanted which didn't work. Another huge issue is that based on this flaw, you will love the food ressource within the research station, because food gets bad over time and you have to cook it again, so it took me real time HOURS to try it over and over and over again, handling the idiots trying to take away the food, while going to hunt down rabbits to get mean, gather mushrooms, cook the stuff on my own because the AI might eat it themselves and then put it into the research station just to see that nobody is coming to research the stuff ...So overall, i think the game is a mess, because of the AI and poor design choices (why can't i research stuff myself? why can't i prevent AI from getting stuff out of buildings? why the priority system and not just me assigning people to buildings and make them work only there?). Even if you would assume it has potential, it doesn't. The linear progress system, the lack of complexity and the very few ressources and items will make it a routine grinder, meaning that you will only do the same stuff over and over and over, just to get a new building, which doesn't make the game better or more fun. What Bellwright lacks - besides the mentioned issues above - is some sort of flexibility to decorate your village OR create micromanageable production cycles with your workers. At this point the game is pretty boring after 15-20 hours, gets repetetive very very fast and exploring the map is also you just running through another forrest, seeing another bandit group and shooting arrows at another deer or rabbit, which is now just further away from your camp.So overall, i can't recommend this game to anybody, because the people who enjoyed Medieval Dynasty will probably miss all the decoration stuff and the ones who were expecting a survival game or some sort of city building RPG mix will be very dissapointed. I got my time out of the game, so it wasn't a waste of money, but man managing this AI fkers is a pain in the a**.--- Update on the 18th of March ---AI is still bad, nothing changed. Did test it with several ways, but it still takes out needed material from the research storage and doesn't research for several hours, having several AI NPCs on idle, researching prioritized on 1 and all the materials being in the storage.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

dave562,43.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198010935376/,"April 24, 2024",8,"The fundamental pieces of the game are there. The resource gathering and building elements seem to be working well. It feels like the devs have done a good job of calibrating how long it takes to do things with how much time is available in the day. By that I mean, by the time the sun starts setting, I am always wishing that I had more time left in the day. And then making a mental check list of what needs to be done the next day.Because of the way the labor and gathering has been setup, it feels meaningful to get additional followers who can take care of the tasks, like gathering food and wood, that you have to take care on your own when you first start the game.This is one of the first places where the game needs more work and polish. The system to assign NPCs to tasks and prioritize their task orders is not very intuitive. The tutorials could use more polish. And the logic needs some help. For example, I armed my followers with axes. Then they started harvesting wood and left their axes in the inventory at the lumber camp.The quest dialogues are extremely bare boned. I can't fault the devs for that given that it is early access. The quests themselves work fine.The combat system is janky. That's the only way to describe it. It needs A LOT of work. The camera angles / zoom get wonky in combat. Often times the NPCs, like wolves, will run past your character and you lose sight of them. The attack animations are jerky. TBH at this point, my experience with combat thus far is just mashing the attack button and making sure that my character has enough hit points to take the inevitable hits. The block attack needs a lot of work. It's not clear if you're supposed to time the blocks in response to attacks. Or hold it down, then counter attack after the NPC attacks.I like how the game is setup to require provisioning your companions when traveling away from camp. For example, I tried to take 3 followers with me to clear out some wolves at a nearby village. I had food for them, but not enough. One companion left me about half way there to go eat some berries. Another companion left me after we had killed about half of the NPCs we needed to. A third companion stuck around until the end.From that experience it became clear that for my next trip, I am going to have to prepare a bunch of food to keep the companions happy.This is another area where the game could use some improvement. Companions should have a mechanic to keep themselves fed. There is already a ""Top Up"" crafting mechanic. That mechanic will have the companions create items whenever the number of available items falls below a set threshold. For example, you can make sure that there will always be 3 animal traps available. That same mechanic should be applied to companions. They should be able to cook and feed themselves. Or at least, pull food out of the camp storage.All things considered, this game is in a good state for Early Access. I hope that it continues to improve.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Red123,17.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198031442612/,"June 29, 2024",13,Picked this up a few days ago. Supposedly there was a QoL update recently... What this game needs is an actual QoL update. Maybe someone who has played the game.I actually like the in depth crafting but storage needs to be up to par if you have so many different items. Basically u need to make a chest a day to keep up with what you need. And now that you have chests everywere watch the ai try to navigate and use them.. The time gated quests.... seriously yup come back no earlier than 24 in game hours.. Running around for quest or babysitting the ai at base. This game is suppose to be about getting enough npc's together to have a army to go conquer.. i was hoping it would be a army of 100's not 10 and have to check every single 1 of them for food and bandaids before leaving base because they will instantly try to put the items away if there not set to comapnion.The npc's dont like to work to far from home so if you truly believe that a massive village with a big army is possible. Well its just not realistic with the small return from gathering and or farming. There needs to be some fixes and i can not recommend this game at this time.,Not Recommended,Early Access Review

As such I cannot recommend this game, even if I really want to, its just not near what it should be and without a really decent detailed developer path showing what they intend to implement later it would be premature to endorse this game in its current state.Pros:Medieval setting is always fun.Complex, has many unique features for a survival game.Graphics are not bad lookingGame-play is relaxed mostly, good for just taking it easy with a survival game instead of running around trying to survive every 5min.Cons:Little content, if I were to explain, then I would say that there should be a hell of a lot more content, the game should have much more detail for what its trying to achieve here. e.g., domestic animals like a dog that can also be a follower. Companionship's beyond followers e.g., NPCs that are part of story or can be with own side quests.Simple things not included, NPC's walk around aimlessly in villages, have no discussions, there are no kids around playing and things like that, breaking immersion significantly. Combat mechanics are similar to Kingdom Come Deliverance but more clunky (if thats possible) making combat hard and its simpler to use a bow and aim for NPCs heads.Combat is more about numbers and NPCs swarm you too easily which gets you killed in no time.Missing game-play mechanics like sneaking, stalking prey or persons, pick pocketing, stealing, lockpicking, things of that nature are needed in this game.No mounts or way to move about map without fast travelling and then your followers can't use that option either...NPCs are often clueless and while they expected to perform somewhat complex activities in the village, they simply can't because its not in there behaviour controls e.g., I have to stop them cooking all the mushrooms on the smoker by disabling it completely, there is no way to tell them to only cook enough. Same as overstocking, they will keep farming from a farm or fertiliser until your storage's are full. Setting it all up is not intuitive or fun and sometimes I feel those mechanisms should almost be automatic instead of requiring incessant micromanaging.Difficult, but for all the wrong reasons, the mechanisms themselves are not very intuitive and often the game leaves me frustrated.All in all its not bad, has much potential, but I am afraid its very far from what it could and should be and what I fear is that the game will lose interest because of its current state, not only from the public but from the developer when they realise the public will not support this game or recommend it IMO...",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

I think many players don't quite understand how it works. So quite difficult to master. If anything, much work is needed to make combat more user friendly. Still, I would not stop playing the game over this.NPC AI Voices:One of the main complaints! However, the devs have said there will be AI voices initially. It is even stated in the game. This will be removed at a later point. So, just stop moaning about it as if the devs thought they would trick us in some way.Renown:The game relies on renown. You need to obtain this from doing good deeds, helping people, and fixing bandit problems. It is a currency. The more renown, the more people will allow you to hire/buy them into your party or village.Companions:You hire companions, and they can be turned into workers and guards for your camp or villages. They can also be turned back into companions. NPC's also have stats such as crafting, and farming. So like you, many stats can be upgraded and changed as time goes on. You can view their stats prior to hiring, so decide whether it is worth it or not. The worker system is a HUGE part of the game. Probably a main defining feature. Without it, Bellwright would be a very different game. So you need to get to grips with it and use it to its full advantage. You won't get very far without it. NPC's are needed to progress and to do tasks for your village/camp/outposts.Research and Tech Tree:Pretty huge for now. Many items and workstations require researching before you can use them. Exploring and obtaining materials is important. Setting up outposts for various resources can also be done so you are not trying to get resources yourself from some far off location.Crashing and Bugs:In the time I have played I have had one crash. It could have something to do with me starting to record my gameplay with OBS as prior to using it I had no problems for about 5 hours. Besides some strange path finding and animals doing weird things wandering around, nothing much to moan about in this area. I know others have complained about crashes, but just saying that no problems on my side.Dev Involvement:So far there appears to have been about 3 or 4 update patches in the past day since the game launched into early access. So, the devs appear to be involved and trying to sort out major problems ASAP. Well done so far!Overall Thoughts:A lot of work still to be done. Combat is my main problem with the game.

Bring some patience.*Previous Review*Enjoying it so far as a fan of survival and realm management games.  Here are some pros/cons:Pros:1.  Lot of freedom in how to build and expand2.  Need to figure out a lot of things, which I suppose can be a con if you're somebody that likes more of a hand-held experience, but I really like it.3.  Deep building and crafting tree4.  Attribute and skill development for character and all followers is fun.5.  Reputation building and recruiting new followers make sense and is enjoyable.  It's nice to see your village grow (even though the followers aren't as useful as I'd like yet).Cons:1.  Combat is pretty terrible.  2.  Raid strengths ramp up pretty quickly, which wouldn't be as big of a deal if not for the next con.3.  Followers are very inefficient.  I built two different ""settlement"" areas - one by a good gathering/mining place and one near the main city/forest.  My followers will constantly spend their days trekking between the two locations even though I tried to set their jobs to the buildings in one location and put them in a house at that location.  I even made delivery a very low priority for all of them and they still spent all day walking between settlements.  Follower controls and task management need a significant amount of work.Overall I'm enjoying it so far.

Not sure why the sale though.)Story-6/10 ( you get blamed for something you didn't do and have to go into exile until you get older and get revenge for being ran out of town.) Down with the bloody big head.Tech Tree- 7/10 (standard tech tree with unlocking branches, easy to read after a few mins, and tutorial shows how to progress the tree and unlock various branches.)Overall the game at this time I'll give a solid 6/10 being early access. A huge chance to grow here, but it depends on what the devs do within the next week of release.

Honorable Harbinger,155.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198022369773/,"May 9, 2024",2,"This game is worthy of anyone's time, whether you like building and surviving, questing, or simply enjoying a new world to explore.  I give this game a 10/10The combat is probably the only part of this game that would be considered far less polished, however the ability of your character is absolutely locked behind time/practice/skill.  If you manage to get your attributes and skill type leveled up, I can foresee it being faster paced.The companions work well, with a Rimworld style command and control system for managing them.  They fight pretty well, and I was impressed with my AI archers targeting their AI archers first when the melee group locked into combat.This is a hidden gem, I expected to refund this game, instead I played all night and thought about during my breakfast.I am aware of the Developers previous failings and I am all for destroying bad developers, however they have also released games that I see people rating down with 1000s of hours in them simply because 'not done'.

NoobtasticGaming,76.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199096658256/,"May 2, 2024",2,I honestly love how this game works. I think it is so unique and brings a slightly different take to the typical survival builder or city builder game. I like that it has aspect of so many different types of games. You have the strategy of a city builder. You have the tech trees and gathering and building of a survival builder. You get an interesting play style and combat system that Isn't like most other games. And there is a fun storyline in the game too. Plotting your revenge against the evil queen and overthrowing the local village brutes.,Recommended,Early Access Review

Friendly looking guy,34.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/friendlylookingguy/,"April 23, 2024",26,"Negative reviews explained:-""Combat is bad""Combat feels just as smooth as it did in Last Oasis. If there is anybody complaining about that - it's likely they don't like being punished for just brainlessly smashing random buttons, because this game will punish you hard for that.-""graphics suck""the visuals in this game are actually fine, they're not gonna revolutionize the genre but they are better than lots of other titles in the genre. -""AI voice acting is bad""Games like Bannerlord have no voice acting at all, so I don't really mind the AI. If you can't stand AI voice acting better play something else. It's pretty subtle though, I didn't notice it until after a couple dialogues.-""I have performance issues even though my PC is from space in the future""No. I am literally playing this on a 2018 machine with a 2070rtx and I don't have any performance issues whatsoever. If you experience performance issues it's probably time to spend your money on new hardware instead of new releases.-""Devs abandoned some other game""To be fair, Last Oasis wasn't abandoned. In fact, they are still releasing updates for that - even though it's pretty much a dead game with 80 concurrent players on steam charts at this time. Anyways, I don't really understand what this has to do with anything.TLDR:The game is pretty much a mashup of Medieval Dynasty and M&B Bannerlord. You decide if you'd enjoy that. If you don't, the game is probably not for you. I think it's a decent game, but at this point in time it's not overly polished (yet?). I've definitely played worse EA titles before, I'd say it's one of the more polished EA titles out there. At this price point it's fine to give it a go.",Recommended,Early Access Review

If you're seeking a masterclass in janky mechanics and lag that transcends the digital realm, look no further. The game's optimization appears to have been lovingly crafted by a committee of blindfolded developers, each vying for the prestigious 'Most Unplayable' accolade. Every frame drop is a unique artistic statement, and the character customization provides all the creativity of a standardized passport photo booth-minus the charm.Given the developer's illustrious history of six abandoned games, this latest endeavor radiates 'grab-and-go project' vibes with the sincerity of a snake oil salesman. One wonders if the team was genuinely aiming for anything beyond a swift cash grab before the inevitable tumble into their growing graveyard of forgotten dreams. But hey, perhaps there's a market for games that leave you pondering whether you're more frustrated by the gameplay or the brazen disregard for quality.If you're the connoisseur of frustration masquerading as entertainment or just love the thrill of repeatedly questioning your life choices, Bellwright is your magnum opus.

Nox,23.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nox_Dragon/,"May 1, 2024",2,"01 may 2024 -------------Interesting mix of paradigms with some good ideas and some terrible ones.  Brilliant in concept, marginally tragic in execution in some ways. There is a showstopper of a design choice for us, right now as is currently designed where recruiting more followers is a linear cost increase that is very significant.  The developers claim ""part mount and blade"" but that ends at a mob of somewhat controlled guys getting killed by enemies that wear armor and wield weapons but drop a potato and pocket change.  The linear cost to hire even shabby homeless guys means you'll be grinding hours of quests or murdering enemies to recruit one more guy, against waves of enemies that spawn without cost.  One of the game's two very poorly thought out mechanics.Solve that, and you have what games like Sengoku Dynasty failed to deliver.   Until someone mods that tragedy out, however, I think most people will find the game as frustrating and difficult to fathom as we did.The other enduring and frequently encountered design tragedy we are seeing in survival games so often is the bizarre and overwhelming error of having items that are produced require 10 to 100 times as many resources as they should require, in worlds that are comparatively tiny.  A plank shield requires 3 logs.  A big tree provides 3 logs.  A plank shield requires as much wood as approximately 100 actual shields.  The idea that a deer provides a meal for a day, and that crafting items requires 100 times the resources isn't balance, it's foolishness that can only stem from a complete lack of comprehension about the real world. Why would you design a system that was a mockery of actual fact at the expense of both the player's experience and plausibility?That said - the game still delivers what other games have tripped over themselves about.  I can't promise the developers will come to their senses, but modders certainly will.",Recommended,Early Access Review

The game is an interesting mix of third person RPG and city builder. People have compared it to a plethora of other games, but it's a bit unique. A little Medieval Dynasty-esque, but very different from that game.At first, I was put off by the character models. When I installed the game, the graphics defaulted to medium, and I almost refunded the game before I noticed. Play it on at least high to avoid cringing.The controls are very click heavy. You pretty much click for everything except interacting with people. This took some getting used to. Personally, I prefer having a keybind to use for harvesting, but it isn't a deal breaker.People have complained about NPCs letting food burn and not doing this and that. This game is really about resource management - your NPCs being resources. You need to adjust their priorities. Always have at least 1 NPC whose #1 priority is cooking, and you will very rarely have burned food. When you do, make 2 NPCs that prioritize cooking.You also have to take into account of placement of buildings in game. Inventory Management and Logistics are keys to success.Hunting is a bit challenging - at least initially. There is no ""stealth mode"". There is deer sees you/deer doesn't see you. Approach slowly. Overall I am pleased with the game so far, and can't wait to see what else is added.Tips:- Research foraging hut first as you can as it'll give you basic food and wood collection early on.- Besides doing Main and Side Quests, your initial first goal is to survive the winter, so make sure you stock up on lots and lots of food.- Next priority should be making sure your NPCs are kitted out in the best weapons and armor you can make. Make sure you invest in upgrading them.

My point is, we should be reviewing games based on the game itself. Not some political grudge match against the developers that gave you hundreds of hours of content at sub triple A prices. If you have more to say on another game... say... any other game that comes to mind you should probably go play that, review that or shut up about that.So how is Bellwright? Yeah, it's pretty good. Did you like Medieval Dynasty? Do you enjoy Mount and Blade? Do you have three friends? Well, if you answered yes to at least two of the above you'll probably like this too. (I bet I can guess the two.) If none of the above apply to you then I would instead invest in a turkey baster and let your folks know it's not too late to try again.Red Banana were the good guys and did nothing wrong.",Recommended,Early Access Review

There is nothing promised besides what is in the game right now. Speaking of which, let’s talk about that!As of today, April 24th, Bellwright is in a good state with plenty to do. Combat is skill based, and I actually mean it. If you suck at directional blocking you’ll struggle. However, that’s not the end of the world! The entire point of the game is creating a settlement and army to go with you, and send them to face your enemies.Speaking of the settlements, they’re surprisingly detailed, albeit a bit difficult to grasp at first. You need to be careful about how you set things up as it can be a struggle at the start. It costs renown to recruit new people, and that’s a precious resource in the beginning.Once you have a couple recruits, they remain mostly autonomous. They’ll work all day and only take a break to quickly eat some food, and there’s very little you need to do to manage them.I’ll cut it short there, but the question remains. “Should I get this game?”I think yes. There’s a risk we’ll never see it reach full release, but the game as it is right now is good.

Combat is really the only downfall here in my experience, you get overwhelmed pretty quickly due to the lack of being able to dodge and the fact that you  swing/slash slower than your opponent/s. Also another thing I've seen is that when you set your settlers to guard they tend to wander 2-3 km away and when a raid or anything happens to your settlement , they are no where nearby and you pretty much get steamrolled and die constantly.

I understand that chests and stockpiles allow for stacking, but your personal inventory does not. So that means at best you pick up 29-30 of any one item. Logs take up 9 spaces in your inventory, which is huge and just looks so silly imo. each piece of food uncooked or cooked takes up a slot. You can only hold 30 arrows in your quiver otherwise it takes up 6 slots in your inventory.By the time I am ready to go out and do some fighting or farming, I have already used up half my inventory on carrying food and tools. It absolutely sucks.I have been told as the game progresses it gets better because you get more and more followers who start to do some of the more mundane things but so far my handful of followers don't collect enough to support even just my little bit of crafting. I am constantly running out and getting more wood or logs even though I have a guy who is working out of my logging camp. Things are very spread out and with the limited inventory it makes for a very bad experience. Not too far in you will find you can build road signs that act as fast travel points, but they must be placed by roads. So getting around the map isn't that horrible once you start placing those around, though they use some of your renown that you want early on for grabbing new followers and such.I don't know. I really want to like this game, and I do feel some kind of way about the devs because I came from the Last Oasis beta and was in the Discord when I saw them acting a fool and banning people they didn't like or gave bad reviews/feedback on their game. My guild leader was one such person that was expressing his dislike of some of the issues in the game and they banned him for it, so my 25 man guild just quit the beta for Last Oasis.I am giving these guys another shot in this game but so far its feeling super cringy. I really hope they improve things and make things not so annoying to get.Combat is atrocious and needs a complete rework. The way they do the combat is a direct copy/paste from last oasis beta and I didn't care for it then either. As a pve game I don't even understand this type of combat but meh it is what it is. I will play this game with my two friends up until early access of Pax Dei gets here, I really enjoyed the Alpha and yes that game is grindy but everything feels like its for a purpose, this game not so much.This game feels more like Valheim or V Rising, both games I really enjoy playing.

Its a pitty the wolf has more stamina than I, an can bite. Where all i can do is die. Death One! Scrap that save..Then next play, I go a different direction. An come across a random bandit camp. Great three vs one. An the archer can laser lock me from god knows what range an is super accurate with his x-ray vision thru the trees, an around the corner BS.. Death Two, respawn back up the mountain side at the very point i entered the game.

Oh you have boxes, lets see what needs cooking. An that would be every thing need to be cooked, i dont care if you need that as a raw component for an upgrade. Or you place him on guard duty, an the next minute he's gone. You'll find him down the road checking out the 'Y' intersection looking dumb.

You get back, to the workbench or research table. Just standing there doing nothing. An if you bring them out to assist you in fighting, that was a even worse idea.

Then I get lost and its a struggle finding my way back to camp5 The Icons above peoples heads should be more noticable and bigger, currently its a white ! and If it was changed to a larger icon and maybe the color was red, yellow or orange it would be easier to see. 6 This is because I could see an issue with it but it doesnt bother me as I'm a horder in the game anyway but you only have 7 days until winter and I didnt even get a farm started before the snow came, and ive noticed I cant harvest the berries, mushrooms or Flax anymore so idk what to bait traps with.7 When you have a companion, EVERY TIME you stop to look around they have the audacity to speak to me and when told to gather something they yell WHOOOO and run off to gather, which is really funny but they talk to much the rest of the timePROS1 Good sized map2 interesting story 3 smooth playing not alot of glitching4 seen a button on the menu that said unstuck(or something like that) 5 the NPC are smarter then normal and actually do what they are told quickly6 You can turn OFF raids which helps as winter is quickly approaching and I'm still learning the game7 The AI voices are pretty cool and actually,as far as I have found, dont really sound like classic AI 8 If i can find someone ( and have the personal time) I think this game as CO-OP and I'd like to see how that playsIN CONCLUSION The game still has work to be done and I personally would like to see the crosshair fixed ASAP ( I did see i could turn it off so i might do that and see if its better).

Try it out and make your own opinion!But the game is old school and doesn't guide you very well with a good tutorial. Which is refreshing, but aggravating at times. The stamina drain is abysmal at best, even eating cooked food doesn't really help that  much since the drain is so fast. Eat 3 different food at the same time and your set for a little while with a decent health buff and stamina buff.The combat could be better. Bringing a companion with you will help you greatly though.Worker management is sort of hard to get a hold of, and if you're not by all the resources you need, well you're out of luck!

We couldnt stop playing for 12 hours straight and fell in love with this game as it provides what we were missing in Medival Dynastie.  Of yourse, there are still some glitches and bugs. But for an Early Access its  def. worth the money.  What makes this game special to me?1. Finally some action due to Raiders and Quests that include to fight them2. Villagers can be used as ""workers"", ""companions"" or ""Guards"".  Not just very helpful if you want to attack or get raided, but also to farm ressources as you can give them whatever you want to farm.3. In terms of tech a very primitive starting which really motivates you to research 4. Chest-Management is awesome as you can  decide what you want your villagers to place in there 5. You can create Outposts in order to protect your village from invaders  6. Fighting reminds me of Mordhau. :-)I still don`t have a lot of playtime but these are first points I really love. More to come I guess. :-) What I think should be improved: 1. Can`t duck - Would be helpfull to hunt as I can`t really hide 2. Mobillity / Movement should be improved. Feels a little clunky, especially when I fight. 3. Bug fixes - Could replicate ""Books"" from quests just by interrupting the conversation by pressing TAB. I kept the book and could choose another one.  Endlessly repeatable as it seems. - Walking through water is weird. Sometimes I just dissapear and spawn at the shore. - Random villagers glitch through the world or sleep on the ground. - Some raiders are glitching through the world aswell.

Overall, I definitely feel like I got my money's worth. What I began to appreciate more and more was how deep and complicated the village management system was over time. As the game progressed, the game seemed to turn more into a kind of first-person Manor Lords simulator.There is definite room for QoL improvement in this game, such as remote inventory management of villagers, gear templates for villager equipment, specific source/destination for deliveries (to/from actual buildings), a way for bandits to circumvent defensive exploits (like impenetrable fences making them easy targets for arrows), ore nodes not respawning (late game issue), a fix for villagers standing idle in the wilderness (starving) because a wolf or boar is there blocking their path (perhaps go around it?), etc.I don't like being forced into being the ""liberator"". I tend to play chaotic-evil characters and don't like being forced into playing a heroic goody-two-shoes. At least give the player the option of moral path to go down.

Done 100 in game hours and gotten to the point where it simply ceases to function properly. I have built a decent township with plenty of decent NPC's but the game seems to choke on itself as the NPC's at a certain point seem to lose direction and wander around aimlessly despite them working perfectly up until I pretty much maxxed out tier 3.Also the fighting mechanics in this game are at best laughable at worst mind numbingly stupid.So why do i recommend the game. Well the potential is huge and it is in early access so if the dev's continue with updates then the game could have a formidable future. For the relatively low price of entry getting 100 hours of play before I hit a wall where it seems the game its engine or the complexity of all my storage the buildings and the 35 NPC's I have running around seem to just overwhelm the limits of what the game can actually handle ??I shall start later by removing some NPC's and see if things improve.Considering that for myself I hit 100 hours before issues began then the game is enough fun in its early build to warrant the relatively low cost of entry. I am just one of those optimistic types that hope that the dev's continue to progress.I was tempted to hit the NO button but I could not ignore how much fun I have had up to this point.

Vendrio,101.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/vendrio/,"May 22, 2024",1,"I highly recommend this game despite its current early access status and various issues. With over 4 hours of gameplay, I've found myself deeply engaged with its intricate village-building mechanics and immersive medieval setting.Pros:Extensive Content: The game is packed with content, even in early access. From crafting and building to forming a medieval village and leading a group of rebels, there's always something to do.Engaging Gameplay: The satisfaction of transforming peasants into a plate-clad army and building a thriving village from scratch is unparalleled. The game encourages strategic thinking and resource management, making every achievement feel earned.Graphics and Ambiance: The graphics are impressive, and the Slavic ambient background music perfectly complements the game’s medieval setting.Responsive Developers: The devs are actively listening to player feedback and implementing fixes quickly. For instance, they addressed the issue of NPCs dropping weapons by introducing a patch that added a new slot for tools.Challenging yet Fair: The game doesn't hold your hand, which can be refreshing. You learn through gameplay, figuring out strategies on your own without excessive guidance.Cons:Travel Issues: Traveling can be tedious due to the vast map and slow movement speed. The game could benefit from the addition of horses or faster travel options for companions.Combat Mechanics: While archery is functional, melee combat feels basic and clunky. The AI pathing is also problematic, often leading to NPCs getting stuck.Bugs and Lag: As expected in early access, there are bugs that can be frustrating. Lag, especially during resource-intensive tasks, can significantly hinder the gameplay experience.Building System: The building mechanics can be cumbersome, with invisible objects blocking placements and slight inclines preventing structure support. This becomes more problematic at higher building tiers.Voice Acting and Technical Issues: The voice acting quality is subpar, and there are some technical issues like lag and power consumption that need addressing. Additionally, the game crashes frequently, which can disrupt the experience.",Recommended,Early Access Review

I think a lot of the stuff can be explained with potentially small pop-up windows giving a brief explanation so you do not have to waste days of grinding for little to no progress. But it is all part of the learning curve, but it is still fun no matter what. I did not have a good time when I got my settlement raided, and lost 37 items THE FIRST RAID, you would think it would be not so much, but apparently my focus was not on the right things, and I got punished. But shortly after I made the correct steps to recruit more, obtain strong companions, and get them equipped with a few items for combat. I did not have any more issues with raids and i quickly forgot about the original severe loss. It goes to show once you get going, you will enjoy it and you won't be bothered so much even when things go wrong. The game has co-op but i have not played it with anyone yet, that is the thing i feel like I am missing out on, so MY ADVICE is to look for someone to play with you, so you can learn faster, progress faster, and increase the potential fun you have overall. Great game, wish there was a little more in depth explanation about combat, how to direct your followers, and how to prepare for raids or Winter!

So many, that the creator locked the bug reporting topic and made a page on their website for it.  There's some typical early access ones that you'd expect to see, floating rocks, buggy textures, etc.  No big deal.  However, when you move settlements and it softlocks all of your settlers into zombies that just wander around aimlessly until they die?  THAT's a pretty big one.  Conquer a city (a normal part of the game) and it soft-locks you out of progressing?  Again...pretty big deal.There's so many bugs that soft-lock your save or corrupt your save, that I can't in good faith recommend this.  Personally, my 10-hour save is fried from moving people from one settlement to another and it locked me out of researching and progressing in any way, shape, or form.  Basically I have to reroll the save and pray that it doesn't happen again.

Menus are cumbersome, and I encountered several glitches that disrupted my progress.Lack of Optimization: Performance can be rough, especially during battles or in larger settlements. This detracts from the overall experience.Shallow at this Stage: The core gameplay loop feels repetitive.

Most importantly, I am having tons of fun playing it.  Building mechanics are a bit more realistic than many games - you don't click and watch a bar, and then WHAM - you have a building.  You must place the resources and then walk around the skeleton of the building, adding the pieces and parts (each of which you had to collect or make).  Sometimes, you have to have a specific tool in hand.  So a bit grindy, but also realistic.  The balance of grind to realism is just right.  My biggest issue might be that the AI for the NPCs you recruit is not that good.  I will have one person making items that require items to be in the storage to build, and another NPC will grab them and take them back to the storage. They work against each other a bit.

I built my first Village Hall, and honestly it feels almost like a slog. Building the Village hall itself can take 45 minutes to an hour if you do it by yourself, because you have to click on every bit of material on the building itself. The settlement management in this game can be a little bit of a chore because a single mistake in the priority list can make your  settlers idle around for hours. I lowered the raid strength on my game as well because for me at least, moving soldiers from one settlement to another for defense is quite tedious because the settlers cannot use fast travel, and there is no caravan system in the game yet (I hope they add one in the future). Feeding the militia can be tedious too and the soldiers run off if you don't feed them. They need to streamline the progression real good so that this game will be able to retain your attention and not make it feel like too much of work.

By far the best game this developer has released.- Like Medieval Dynasty. But with more pressure as waves of attacks continue to come.- fairly large tech tree for an Early Access game.- Perma death of villagers. Game has consequences if you fail.- Map is fairly large and you can start your town anywhere you want. Spent hours running around the map. North of the map isn't completely done but you could settle down in the middle of nowhere for a challenge.- Combat is decent. You control your swings and direction.- You also control formation of villagers when fighting. Found this to be a little wonky for me. But seen YouTube Videos of players during an amazing job on formations and defense.- Completing this game will take weeks of gameplay.Negatives------------ Early Access still got bugs and crashes. Save system for the most part keeps you from losing too much time when it crashes. But stability is an issue.- Developers have history of not completing games. Past is not a good sign but the game could sell as many as MD did over time which may keep them involved.- Can sometimes exploit attacks as terrain is a little buggy for the AI.Overall really enjoying the game. Restarted a few times to test starting areas and to see how fast I can move of the tech tree. And bug fixes have been coming in daily.,Recommended,Early Access Review

The timers for the food seem worst and more annoying than the food system in Valheim.In the beginning, nothing stacks in your inventory, so you'll have all of your slots filled with 1x rocks in each slot.If you DO happen to craft a stackable storage box, rocks only stack up to 5x per slot. But your bag will still always only be able to hold 1x per item PER slot.You start out nearby this village and if you try to harvest plants, rock, sticks, literally ANYTHING near or in the village, it will tell you you can't because it belongs to the village.The NPC system also works similar to Stardew Valley where everyone is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to you in the beginning and you have to earn their approval.Like I get this is a survival game, but survival doesn't have to be annoying or tedious lol.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

You earn renown by accomplishing certain quests or killing bandits. Renown is a resource that allows you to recruit villagers to your villages that you create. This is not Farmville, which also makes this cooler. Bandits will attack you via a built-in raid feature or random bandit patrols. Your villagers, if you arm them, will help defend their homes and settlement.Your villagers can be made into workers, companions, or guards. Workers will do tasks you deem fit in a 1-9 priority task meter format. Companions will allow them to follow you, which I love; roaming around with my 9 beggars, slaughtering bandits, lol.To start off, I recommend hiring beggars as they suck and require the least amount of renown. This can help you establish your village, seeing as more hands means less work for you personally.If you need help in the Discord with support, I recommend tagging Misper and/or Pogosan.

For certain people.As an example, I feel like if you're the person that stays behind at base when your friends run off to do stuff, this game is great. It is a lot of base management/building and like any game in this genre, you will need to get resources to build the things. However, in THIS survival game, if you're not playing with friends, you get to recruit settlers. They will work, gather, and protect in your name, should you be able to afford hiring them. You can gear them up, bring them to bandit camps with you, or leave them at home to tend the farm and craft your ropes.Now; if you are a person who loves to go out and fight, explore, loot, then this game is also pretty great for that! There are a ton of interest points on a fairly large map, and there are also a ton of bandit camps and (from what I see) bandit...castles? - I'm only about 20 hours into the game, so don't ask me about the endgame life. As for a quick list of features in the game:- can be successful coop or singleplayer- combat is exactly like Mount and Blade, if a bit modernized- there is fast travel (you must unlock/craft it)- there are many NPCs in the game. it won't feel dead, like fallout 76 or something.- there is hunting, traps+bow+maybe other things- combat is DIFFICULT. You will not walk through every enemy like you do in say, Enshrouded.- food/eating system is exactly like valheim, which I like personally.- you can shortcut skillboosting by reading books like in Project Zomboid.- building system is okay; not too in depth (at least so far) and fairly straight forward.- summer/winter cycle. winter has sucked every time so far. cant find animals. cant find berries. (you cant starve, just cant feed your allies)- always something to do (you unlock patterns/crafting through a table exactly like Rust. research everything)- QUESTS. A survival game with QUESTS you can get from villages and wanderers. (this adds a lot to the gameplay loop!)There's more, but I feel like that's enough to determine whether you should at least try it out in the first place. Refunds exist for a reason!

Or trudging up a mountain in the winter with a gale force blizzard. This alone adds so much to the immersion, fantastic stuff and the lighting is excellent. Darks are dark not some pseudo lighting.

Some interesting ones too that have made me chuckle (Im looking at you with the pet Boar)Tech Tree and Grind - Progress is slow but rewarding, i sit down and feel like im in it for the long haul, not something you can complete in a night or two.

tobi,14.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198085175978/,"April 27, 2024",5,"At this point I would not recommend this game. The bottlenecks in progression are just tedious and never feel rewarding when you finally reach them. The Valheim like food mechanic of increasing stamina and health by eating are just a hindrance here, as items do not stack in your inventory so going out exploring is constantly slowed down by not having HP or Stam to continue. The buffs also last for what feels like 5 minutes, there are better foods but they're few and far between in the early game.Movement feels sluggish and auto run only walks. trying to jump over anything higher than 1/2 way up your shins is a struggle unless you're on a downhill trajectory, also if you have no forward motion before jumping you just go straight up and not over.The combat feels like garbage, especially when you're fighting more than 2 enemies.The settlers are enjoyable in combat but are constantly screwing around in your base, sure they do jobs and you can set priorities but they seem to have a mind of their own and go ""nah, not today"". They move your items around, taking materials from a workbench that you placed for crafting of an item.The game has promise but I find it insulting that a developer would release it in this state and charge the amount they are charging for it. I can't lie, I have enjoyed moments but i have ended multiple hour+ long sessions feeling like I haven't progressed at all.

@SuppressWarnings,46.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SuppressWarnings/,"April 27, 2024",1,"I like this game a lot. Coming from Medieval Dynasty and Sengoku Dynasty, this game does everything it does better, and more on top of it. The job priority system for your settlers is a mixture of Rimworld and Oxygen Not Included in that each settler has a 1-9 priority for each category of jobs, and which job site has a priority system as well. I like the level of control the game affords you in that respect, while also not feeling required to micromanage to that level of detail if you don't want to since the settlers are very autonomous with default settings.The raiding system is an interesting mechanic that I hope gets expanded on more. Early on you need to attack bandits to get a particular resource needed to advance to the next tier in the tech tree. Every time you attack bandits it raises your threat level, and they will eventually mount a raid against you. The game gives you 24h notice when this will happen, which is pretty immerse-breaking so I hope they replace this system at some point with an intrigue system so it fits into the game better. Raiding difficult can be adjusted at any point in the game or disabled entirely.Combat works and doesn't feel unfair, though it does need more polish. Your hits feel slow and unimpactful. It's a directional combat system and is really difficult to control your direction of attack/block with KBM. Overall though it works as advertised.Inventory management is also something that is an adjustment coming from similar games. Nothing stacks in your inventory, and larger items take up more blocks in your inventory grid. Items do stack in your storage buildings, though. The game does not explain this to you, but you can move individual items between your inventory and storage by a single left click, a slider of items from storage to your inventory with ctrl + click, and all items of the same time with alt + click.All your settlers can function as either a worker, companion, or guard. When in worker mode, it works like RImworld. They're completely autonomous and follow the rules set by their priorities and the priority of jobs. In companion mode, they will follow you and you are given options on how they should engage in combat and can give them orders to move to specific spots. I haven't used guard mode yet as it seems more suited for when your settlement is larger, but from what I've read they patrol the outskirts of your settlement. You can form an army of your settlers which turns every person placed in the army into your companion. This is nice when you need to quickly convert your people into companion mode to deal with an incoming raid.The questing system is pretty generic, with fetch quests, talk to X quests, and craft X item quests. The game does give you lots of quests though, so you can pick and choose what you want to do and ignore what you don't want to do. Doing quests is how you earn you renown with the NPC settlements, which increases your reputation with them and expands your options for recruiting into your settlement.Overall I'm impressed with this for EA. It feels like all the groundwork is in place and the game does not feel empty. Traveling by foot to places is a chore, but you do unlock a rather cheap option for fast travel early into the game. There's dozens of hours of entertainment already available if the play-style suits you. It was well worth the buy for me, and those who like survival colony sims will find this enjoyable as well. I've not had any performance issues or crashes, though I did just build a new computer. I can run all settings at max and have a consistent 144fps.",Recommended,Early Access Review

I have not had it crash once and have played for over 32 hours now.  There is a small learning curve but is easy to learn.  Villagers will do a lot of the tasks needed but they need to have the proper levels to do the tasks as well.  Make sure to give a bit of space so they don't get stuck.  IE don't place work stations right next to storage and everything will work just fine.  Combat is fun and the right mix of challenge.  You can focus on building, leveling, quests, resources or fighting and have your recruited NPCs do the same.  Once you learn how your settlement is easy to manage and you can start taking NPCs with you and explore the map.  The one item there needs to be a little more of are the quests.  I have completed almost all the quests for both nearby towns in the starting area and reached a status slightly over friend but don't see a real path to progress from there.",Recommended,Early Access Review

HIGHFRIENDS,35.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198182700845/,"April 24, 2024",2,"Honest review.Disclosure! I personally do not like this company from its prior games and how they treated them. However after one of my friends wanted me to try this game i gave in as it had a lot of aspects i enjoy. I honestly still feel a little on the fence on the future of this game but only time will tell. Now game play review.After putting in a couple hours i can say with confidence that its actually really pleasant and i have yet to encounter game breaking or visual bugs. The AI voices sometimes bug out and growl at you but subtitles seem to always be on. The Inventory system is a little odd to work around because items don't stack but if you change your view and think about your character as a IRL person its fairly accurate if you were super human. The purpose of the poor personal inventory is to encourage players to build up your settlement and have NPCS do the heavy lifting and you act more like a governor. The combat is kinda funky but once you fight a few times its not to bad. Its similar to for honor blocking mechanics but attacks can be prolonged if you hold attack button causing you to have sluggish movements. I have not used archery as it is a research that can take a little bit to acquire so i cant give info on that. Multiplayer My play through was with 2 other friends of mine and it seems like multiplayer is fairly solid. quests are shared between everyone and the currency you receive is also shared (gold, Rep with towns). Controlling the AI in the town seems to work fairly well if multiple people are trying to change settings for the town. Fights in multiplayer also seems fairly decent, the host does have advantage on blocking/parrying due to latency but its still manageable with 70+ ping. Overall I enjoy the early game that is available and hopefully when i get into raiding the large bandit camps with my trusty Beggars as cannon fodder i can update on how mass scale battles actually work or if there is any game breaking issues.TLDR Multiplayer good so far game-play is decent combat can be sluggish and clunky 7/10 rating overall",Recommended,Early Access Review

Scooby,28.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067207576/,"April 24, 2024",1,"Okay so I waited to get some time in this game before I reviewed it. With 5.7 hrs I think now I have a good idea of the game. This entire review is going to be based on the FACT that the game is Early Access. Has NOTHING to do with the developer or their past work, strictly looking at the game itself. Let me start by saying that a lot of issues with performance are mentioned in day one reviews. If you do not expect to have bugs and performance issues DO NOT BUY this game just stop reading and walk away. Early Access is about helping the devs develop the game into something great, not about playing a perfectly molded game. Now between yesterday and to day early morning for me about 9am. There have been about 5 updates to help performance issues. This has been done because the devlopers and the Community Manager have been very very active in the Discord getting the needed information to fix things. I have seen a few times where inside a hour from reporting an issue the devs have pumped out an update to fix the issue. Co-op was one of those with issues. Right now the game is 4 person CO-OP only or of course Singleplayer. I did see where devs said yesterday 4 player is a start at launch. Yes there was some issues but issues that they needed to test to work out. Early Access is about testing the game for the devs. Yes you PAY to be a Game Tester but you get the game at a reduced cost. Now with a 11th Gen i7 2.6GHz 48GB RAM 3070 GPU I am averaging about 35 FPS on all ultra. Now that works fine for me so no attempt was made to improve it. I can tell you that if your do not have a Graphics Card with AT LEAST 8GB VRAM you might consider NOT buying this game. Some have asked if 4GB VRAM cards will ever be enough devs have said they will try but did not seem hopeful. This tells me that MAYBE 8GB VRAM might work. Gameplay, so far I am really enjoying it despite the annoyances of learning things like where not to build so higher level enemies are not attacking. The AI so far are simplistic but working 99% bug free in the time i have in the game. Story seems to be well done with some thought and planning. Yes there is AI Voice Acting but they are not going to spend money on Live Voice Acting until they get to the end of Development I am sure. The game is about starting out a stranger to villagers and slowly gaining trust. Over time with trust your own village will grow, as will your army. NPC that you recruit do have stats to consider. Some are better workers then they will be fighting. You can set any NPC to either be a worker, Guard, Companion. There is even an option for Guard Reserve which my guess is to use the say blacksmith as a guard but primary duty would be blacksmith work. The graphics are good in my opinion, no not as great as the new Ark but enough that the world feels immersive enough to not realize you have been playing it already for 5hrs. In the end forget the developer and what they have done in the past. After all Car makers and home developers all pumped out poor work as they learned things. Does not mean they are scammers or anything like that, just means they are HUMAN like the rest of us.",Recommended,Early Access Review

They are absolutely not worth it, as they have the trajectory of a thrown towel. Straight for 10 meters and then they divebomb into the ground. Gravity works in very peculiar ways.

Not the core mechanics of it, they're fine, but rather that it's still buggy (Had more than a few attacks get blocked by a shield not even remotely in the way of it) and a few blocks be completely ignored for no reason at all.

If you can chill while doing that, it's ok.I'd suggest to wait for more development, but in it's current state I did get a lot of playtime before I've decided to quit for a while - until said development happens. And there's good indication that it's going to, because some issues were already addressed with the last update.

In Bellwright, you SHOULD rely 90% on AI from my understanding and I swear it feels like I am managing a group of toddlers. They really seem to promote their system where you should have a settlement along with multiple outposts for resources and such. Unfortunately, my villagers always seem to feel the need to travel in-between these outposts/settlements for absolutely no good reason. This in turn causes an issue where they are constantly walking around the map alone either getting beat up by bandits or starving and then start hating me because they are hurt and hungry... This is extremely annoying.The AI is also very confused generally speaking when doing tasks and therefore you cannot rely on them which seems to defeat the whole purpose of the game.I'd give it an honest 6/10. Not great, not terrible.Lots of potential, but really needs to be polished and it's a little sad that the main mechanics the game relies on are quite clunky.

Progress is way to slow, pieces of technology are locked off until you complete major objectives but those objectives are guarded by highly equipped npcs who you can't match because of the said blockCombat is underbaked with no lock on system or way to direct the NPCs in combatNPCs are incredibly hard to control they will start walking halfway across the map to pick up a log or deliver to a construction sight and you can't tell them to stop, its hard to get them to do things when you want. They take things out of chests to move them to another, when they find its full they just drop the stuff on the ground. Travel is really slow.

c-*****,143.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030845867/,"June 24, 2024",2,"This is a good game - for a certain kind of player.  Between that and the current Early Access growing pains (load and quit games take a while), I cannot generally recommend it,  But this can be engaging and even engrossing if you like the play cycle like I do.While it is an FPS, it tries being a medieval management and base-building game too, with minor RPG parts, and since you cannot do anything while it is paused, you may always feel rushed like I do - as well as like you never have enough inventory space.  Never.  And even if you do, AND you allow/disallow/assign to other outposts properly, your villagers may still leave the hoe on the opposite side of the output from where the farm is...  Plus I often find that items are 'in transit' or just don't show up on the outpost's ledgers while I'm staring at a stockpile full of, say, wood!NEW PLAYERS should immediately go to the options and reduce the intensity and frequency of the raids.  Or even turn them off for the first game - or your first couple in-game winters playing the game - so you can get used to things.  Even if you grab a beggar in the first 5 days to be a guard at your outpost, I think that just reduces frequency and not strength of the raids.  Before you get a bow - and set up defensive fences - raids/battles will be frustrating and deadly for those of us who aren't used to this control scheme.  Losses don't end the game, but they do set you back a while.New players should also NOT go to sleep ASAP on the first day.  In fact it seems that the most important part of falling asleep by 6:50AM is auto-waking at 7AM and being told how far away winter is.But giving yourself goals for your outpost does rely on knowing the area and the tech tree - the map is identical for every game (so far).  And resources are specific to areas - sometimes identified with icons on the map.At least one YouTuber points out that stats say that less than half the players have built the Town Hall - which is only the first Tier 2 building (of 3 Tiers), and I believe it.  I did finally build it, but all the buildings - except the initial chest - are much larger than necessary, and can never be built close together - usually needing to be further apart than the game lets you build them - or villagers can get stuck in many places :(  Plus even with some help, building the Town Hall takes almost 3 in-game days of tedious mouse-clicking (and waiting 8 seconds after each click!).  That's not a way to encourage building!  Plus after all that, if you need to move the building (because placing buildings has NO INDICATOR for where actions/entering happen), you lose ALL BUILDING MATERIALS and have to start the whole thing over again :(It can also be frustrating trying to get certain resources before Tier 2/in the first 50 days because patrols really reduce the wild animals you need for certain quests and building certain items.FYI: You can NOT do any research yourself.  Though like any other crafting, if you could, you would just be sitting there waiting for time to pass as the timer filled up to complete it.  Alternatively if you try weeding a plot in the farm, click the button and wait for your character to unfreeze/complete it...So: it is getting better.  Hopefully more, soon.There's also the developer's history of removing their past 2 games which people purchased, which makes people nervous.  Understandably.Whatever you decide, have fun!",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

It's quite satisfying watching individual growth of your colonsits as the level and become more proficient in a variety of skills and same for your hamlets then growing into a village and later into proper towns.Cons: It needs time to cook and somethings don't make a whole lot of sense in the research table like requiring tier 3 material for tier 2 research/crafting stuff, Food consumption is quite high so and long distance traveling with companions or your army just isn't feasible. AI path finding is a bit wonky, several times I had bandits just straight up disappear, colonists becoming frozen in place and unable to respond to commands, usually this is because there is some sort of threat like hostile wildlife ""which spawn almost endlessly and very close if not on roads or in vicinity of towns"" but on a rare occasion even after dealing with the culprit they still refuse to move leaving you not much chose but to dismiss them, which can be very frustrating if it's an apprentice. All in all , I really enjoy the game I've put a lot of hours in and still am, but pathfinding needs work or just AI responsiveness in general, animal spawning/zoning needs adjustment, and just overall  QOL fixes, ""like assigned guards just refusing to eat and quitting their posts when hungry"".",Recommended,Early Access Review

There are many good things in the game and a few things i would love to see improving.The positive:1. there is always something to do being either gathering, fighting or exploring. 2. the enjoyment of making a village grow and make people work in the settlement. 3. the fighting have a good difficulty so it remains challenging even when getting better armor and weapons. 4. the enjoyment of liberation a village is so satisfying 5. the way you try and get better people all the time so they work more efficient. The thing i would like to see improve:1. Some buildings (ex farm and drying rack ect) dont have the option to set an amount to be made so it fast spend your resourses/fill up your storages. 2. Would love to be able to assign 1 person in the village to be a weaver or farmer ect ect. just so its possible to use their best skilled ability and not just assign the priority for ex. crafting or farming. 3. with campfire and smoking rack campfire the villagers can start cooking something and go to bed resulting in burning the food. that have wasted a lot of food for me. 4. its very hard to keep up with making the higher tier food in the village because the villagers eat it as fast as its being made unless you make several campfires with cauldron. maybe something have to be adjusted a little. 5. sometimes animals go on a spawn rampage. resulting in very many animals being in one spot. thinking mostly about the huge wolf packs sometimes. 6. would love to be able to plant trees so you can keep having resourses for you village. of course on a several day timer before it grows up. (i know about the comment about the amount of trees on the map. but still..)7. combat can be a little wierd if you kite a little if you are about to die. suddenly they disengage and run back ofc. but then suddenly without being near the enemies the start attacking again and run miles to get to you. Final conclusion:is Bellwright worth getting at its current state? i would say yes if you are into a slowpace game where you slowly build up your village and still keep in mind its early access. you will be able to spend many hours in it fighting for building up the village and in tier 2 looking to get the right people to research the higher tier building/items you want. if you are the kind of player who want to be able to fast getting your village running and farming the resourses for you the this is not for you. it all takes time.

While it draws a lot of parallels to Medieval Dynasty I think it is more of a combination of RimWorld and Mount & Blade, something I personally have been waiting for for a while, and it's got an excellent foundation to build off of with a big chunk of existing content.Be warned though, this is a slow game, though I personally really like it because the content is there and there's definitely small goals achievable one at a time as you progress.There's a plethora of small QoL issues and bugs, like a lot a lot, and they will affect your game in a variety of ways. I haven't run into anything particularly gamebreaking and the devs have been releasing DAILY fixes for at least 11 days straight since release, but there's a lot to go through,and it will definitely take them a chunk of EA to make this a smooth experience.Fortunately, I haven't really run into any fundamental issues with the game, honestly overall it's pretty great, it runs well on my 2080, I've had 1 crash that made me lose maybe 2 minutes of progression (they've implemented a save system with 3 autosave slots to really try and make sure you don't lose progression).The devs are also pretty active on Discord trying to get feedback and fix bugs, which is also reassuring.TLDR is get this game now if you're willing to put up with a lot of jank, in a few weeks if you're willing to put up with some jank and probably in 6-12 months if you want to minimize your jank exposure, but overall, the game gets a strong recommendation from me.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Blastmetal,50.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025891701/,"April 24, 2024",1,"This game is a little rough around the edges but claim like the graphics are bad and the stamina is a problem, are unfounded, just like in Valheim you eat to get better character preformance, Stamina gains are fine once you get some decent food in your system. Archery is mint and very fun and melee needs help a lack of special moves like middle mousebutton for a poke or something is a bit dishearthening, Melee feels extremely stiff and unresponsive no feints no special moves just simple up down left right attacks no kicking to stagger, thats my only gripe with the game, if they improve on the existing melee in the game i think this could quickly become a very good game.Things i think this game needs to improve.melee overhaul : Really needed like what i stated above.Bag timer: get a indication in the hud or minimap showing how much time you have to claim your fallen loot, i was on the other side of the map when i died got spawned at my house and im guessing my loot despawned since i could not find it very annoying.AI needs better pathfinding : the AI gets stuck very often and this can lead to very weird unpredictable behaviour where fighting them is a pain in the rear. Some optimization should help.Structure placement removes resources without notifying the player: maybe make a shadow blueprint that will also tell you that you are about to remove resources like copper or tin or iron nodes, i placed a mine far away but still fairly close to a copper node and removed copper nodes by accident, this could have been prevented.Some world assets are misplaced and cause your own and world NPC's to get stuck or have movement issues: I found a couple of places especially near river crossings where NPC's are unable to follow the player or get stuck on road lights or terrain. Looks sloppy and ruins the overal preformance of the immersion.Last thing : Im not sure if this planned but having some sort of horse, mule or oxen, with carts would really help travel for both the player and the NPC's, for deliveries over long distances. trading right now in the normal setting takes several moves around long distances from any town hub, and as a result you can't always take what you need since your limited by carry space. I think this game has a lot of potential maybe replace some of the AI voice lines with actual people voice lines might help sell it a bit more since there is a lot of aversion for the usage of AI anything these days.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Feels like a stretched out grind.- Take into account that your inventory is very limited vs building requirments.- Building system is cool at first, becomes a drag after the fifth building / station.- Lack of breaking down logs into smaller sticks makes the game unecessary grinding, especially given you wander randomly looking for sticks.- Voice acting is one of the worst out there.- Pretty at times, ugly most of the time, despite ultra settings.I want to love it, I can oversee the clunky animations in EA, I can oversee the ""Hollywood"" style of fighting (Rush in a weird FFA), but the game needs to improve on a lot of key parts to make it enjoyable and not feel like a chore.Will try it again in 6 months.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

"obnoxiously, placed comma",17.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/middle_thumb/,"April 28, 2024",6,"It's definitely MOSTLY fun, but considering combat was the main reason I wanted to play this game and the combat is extremely frustrating, it's hard to recommend it to anyone in its current state. The devs as far as I am aware are the ones who made the cRPG mod for warband, which was so much fun back in the day. However, I am enjoying this game UNTIL any combat happens. It is very clunky, you are always outnumbered, your weapons have durability and will break over time, blocking affects that durability. Blocks sometimes do not work (I do not know if this is an RNG thing, or a network thing since I was playing with a buddy). You are tied to once choice of a 2h weapon - so you can have a 2h axe for example or a bow. If you  choose a bow, you also need a quiver to hold arrows. BUT, if you die then you also drop arrows. So, you can't shoot it anymore. It's just weird and really annoying. Killing enemies is satisfying, however it's always a little disappointing looting them because they drop the same things every time, and it's never any equipment, just some tier 2 materials and gold or food. I also don't really understand how you're supposed to raise an army. As soon as I tell troops to follow they all disband because they get hungry, but we have farms and a food stockpile so they should be eating, it's just that they don't do it at a convenient time?? There are other things that are annoying, e.g. inventory size is really small which makes it inconvenient to do just about anything. I think the point is to make it clear that having settlers do things for you is the correct way to play, except they all suck at doing everything and they do it slowly. I was just trying to get them to craft a weapon for me because my last one broke mid combat and I could not find any way to repair it, I put the new craft at the top of the list to indicate it as #1 priority, and they just ignored it and kept crafting arrows, which used the materials that I gathered to craft that weapon. So, while I was trying to liberate a village I had to go collect sticks and young trees until my crafters made me the correct item.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

Azrac,18.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Cebrail/,"April 26, 2024",2,"I give this a very tentative Thumbs-Up for several reasons, but first the Pro's and Con'sPro's: It's an innovative new game, with some really interesting mechanics and ideas. While it borrows a bit from this, that and everything, all games do these days and this one actually does it pretty well.The building and gathering is pretty simple, though with a few annoying parts I fail to see a reason for beyond trying to 'stand out'. Having to target 20 points to build a house. Being unable to chop a log because it's too low to the ground. The combat is not horrible, but it is very badly scaled right now, with bandits coming in very quickly increasing sizes and having much better equipment pretty fast. Fighting in itself is trying to do something ala Bannerlords, but because bandits can see where you are hitting from, it feels mostly as a detriment to you than a benefit.Cons:♥♥♥♥ HUNTING DEERS AND THEIR 360 vision over 3000 miles away.The need for an item that you can't craft until late Tier-2 or get from bandits is absurdly stupid. I have no idea why you would add such a mechanic into the game, but get rid of it. Don't ask us to get T2 goods before we can make T2. AI is lacklustre, your people need a LOT of handholding, and in combat they are absurdly stupid.Conclusion: Had this cost more than 25$, I would have skipped it. As it is, I'll get the 25$ worth of fun out of it and move on, hence the thumbs-up. Bare this in mind if you use the review to make your decision.Afterword:The elephant in the room. The developer of this game are known for abandoning their products far from finished, ala Last Oasis and there's zero evidence they wont just continue making medium-effort games and then moving on when they feel they can't suck more money out of people.",Recommended,Early Access Review

The game's visuals are really nice and I found myself at several points thinking about going to a ren faire that felt like it was situated like this. The idea of the game is really neat, and I like being able to ground up and start a territory/village. I played it for quite a while and expect to continue from here. If you like Inventory Management issues, I could see this being a real plus for you, and since this game is a survival craft, I am marking it as a positive here.The negatives. To me the hardest thing was hitboxes, they just didn't feel natural or sensible. If I would prioritize something it would be this because even chopping a tree into logs can be a matter of what pixel your character is slowly swinging an axe at. In line with this the combat felt off because it looks like there is a level of skill needed with combat where opponents are blocking for certain attacks but I don't feel control over how I'm swinging a weapon. This makes you have to play more as Robin Hood and that isn't necessarily the pitch for the game, right?The villager AI seems really rough at times from a management standpoint. Or maybe the UI for management just seems off, but either way I wish it was easier to get villagers to do things I need of them. Needing a research done so people can live only to watch as villagers refuse to do the research in favor of shoveling mud is wild. Also maybe I'm dumb but I couldn't figure out an easy way to get rid of buildings once built. Overall: So, I generally like the game but I wouldn't recommend it because I don't think most people I would like to play this kind of game with would like playing it until some issues are addressed.

I must say it's quite refreshing for the genre. First i'll address the 2 rage quit thumbs down posts on top.  1) ""I was playing and winter hit and i couldn't do all the things.""  Our first winter freeze was pretty quick, like 6 days in.  You can't harvest anything plant based or mud.  it's lasts 1-1.5 in game days.  It' s a constraint, but not the end of the world.  There are plenty of things to do for 2 days ... 2) ""Building is way too manual."" Yeah it takes a ton of clicks to build structures.  Until you get some followers.  When you get followers you can throw down the building footprint and they will go cut the trees and harvest the things and put them there and do each of the building interactions.  To me it really it was a bit much, that part is true, but I think it makes it more rewarding when you build your team to the point that you can just throw down the BP and they come do the rest.  I think playing a 3-man also mitigated some of that grind to get us off the ground.The good:1) The map seems well populated with quests and an advancement Arc.2) The AI settlers that join your team are much more productive than expected.  I really like this immersion of settlement growth.3) There is a task priority system, though everything is still a 5 for us.Cons:1) I'm not a fan of the early access voice acting.  There doesn't seem to be a ton of depth to the quest.  I'm motivated to do all the talking and questing because it unlocks more followers and some tech tree stuff.  I like sandbox games, so this isn't a big road bump for me.2) The dev team seems a bit immature in executing multiplayer.  We havn't had any hard blockers, but we've had some crafting benches disappear during sessions for one player.3) I like exploring this content with my team but it appears (unconfirmed) that it's 4-player-unique co-op, not just 4-player simultaneous.

Love the citizen management, remote queue'g of work while you're away, and the auto ""true up"" foraging, crafting, aka production that citizens can do.  I bet they're really happy they joined!  That said, no idea how to keep them happy or fed :)Speaking of this..there's really no tutorial other than occasional pop-ups which are trying to be helpful, but in complicated melee combat, there's really no substitute for practicing it.  I have yet to get good at melee, so hopefully that's something I get to train up and be better at.",Recommended,Early Access Review

As the game progresses, you set up secondary, smaller towns to reach faraway resources and establish resources exchange systems between them.  There is an important combat aspect, too.The developers have really achieved something extraordinary with this game, and it is even more amazing that despite all the layers of complexity, everything just works.

Honestly, I actually like not having my hand held and figuring out optimal spots on my own. The logistics of gathering raw materials to build parts used for crafting  is awesome. So far this game has me hooked.So far i noticed the priority system doesn't seem to matter to the followers. I have top up amounts for supplies and set the priority of those lower than the priority of research, yet the supplies seem to always be first priority even if i change the individuals priorities. Having the research be the followers lowest priority is frustrating when trying to advance your tech systematically.First glitch I found on my first attempt was night time darkness not taking place. Even though the sky was dark, the ambient light was still present as if it was day. This did not happen again on my restarts.Secondly, when you wake up, the info boxes disappear too fast to read what they are saying. Its minor but would be nice to know if there is any pertinent info I may want/need to know. The combat system is kind of like bannerlord. Its not meant for you take take on more than 1-2 opponents on a time which add a layer of strategic planning I like.The food spoils, which make sense, the best way around it i found so far is to stack all your food in one spot. The item at the ""top"" spoils first but the underlying stack does not spoil simultaneously but rather consecutively after the first one spoils. This helps prepare for winter.So far this game especially in the early stage looks like its one ill be putting solid hours into. Anything that is added or touched up on by the devs is just icing.

It is extremely imbalanced and will take another 6 months at the patch rate to balance out. storage is a nightmare of chaos logistics. You can't control what is in a stockpile until after it's built. But by game mechanics your workers perform the building and by the time you return it's cram full of disorganized random crap. Job prioritization doesn't work. you need a specialist for everything but the bridge to get to any specialist is a grind like OSRS 2007. Army management is 20 minutes of gearing up followers 1 one by with no way to save combat roles; 20 min of marching only for half your troops to quite due to moral/food. Broken equipment is just thrown on the ground costing a ton of resources to recover. Corpse runs are the name of the game but you have such short time limits that you most likely will loose everything. weapon damage is skewed the best bow does 5-15 points damage vs AI doing 100+ damage to you with a tier lower.  game play shows 1v1 footage with almost never happens it's always 5:1 or worse so tactical fighting is out. Food spoils like it was left out in the desert sun so you are spending all your time farming food, cooking is building limited, slow, limited to single quantity with long cook times. so the food you NEED to survive you can't craft enough of to use, or you craft to much and it's all spoiled or you micro manage what every person eats 1 at a time. personal storage is like tetras with an auto shuffle that destroys what your working on, even the top tier ""expanded"" storage leaves you making multiple trips back to your 500 stockpiles to find that 2 pieces of gear you need that you can only carry one of back to your individually managed troops. the player runs like a person who smoked for 30 years, breathing through a wet rag. 100m of lite jog and you have to rest for 15 seconds. AI will randomly sprint away from you at 3x your max movement speed towards the target you are trying to defend and nothing you can do can stop them. trading is useless, the items you spent resources crafting are worth less then the bare starter gear (example townfolk shoes sell for 33 gold and hide boots (tier 2) sell for 26. some items sell for massive amounts but you gain zero gold over your spend. most of the quests are broken or bugged or behind research walls that are 100+ hours away. buggy, grossly imbalanced and combat is crap. with the latest patches breaking the game horribly.

Villagers/Workers seem are still hard to tune to do the tasks you really need them to do. * Code for inventory management clearly has multi-threading / queuing issues.  Completely breaks down if you have too many storage buildings (i.e. 15+ barns, 2 warehouses, 2 stockpiles, 2 weapon racks, 2 arrow baskets, and AI couldn't function really at all). * I literally just watched a guy ""deliver"" a log from my Lumberjack spot and drop it into the Barn that holds logs...  FYI... The lumberjack spot building is used to cut those logs into wood...  But he thought it was best to just put the log back into storage.  I swear...  It's like they coded ""pranks"" into the game.  >.< * Tier 3 is still a work in progress.  For example the Bakery and the Inn aren't really in the ""Cooking"" rotation for priority (in cooking pots and bakery set to priority 1 with campfire cauldrons set to priority 2, and 1 smoking rack set to priority 4.  smoking rack and campfire cauldrons are the only things producing). * Priority of items to produce is terrible especially with cooking.  If you have a Berry Jam recipe on anything (any kind of berry jam recipe) it'll almost always be produced before anything else regardless of where it's positioned in the list. * Completely skipped Tavern as it took forever to get an Innkeeper.  Built the Tier 3 Inn and talk about a disappointment.  2 Cauldrons.  That's it.  Nothing else to cook from.  Just.... /facepalm. * Tech Tree and progression is all messed up.  You'll be deep into tier 3 (all armor, weapons unlocked) before you can even build a tavern.  The Innkeeper should be available in one of the earlier towns you liberate (padstow or bradford) and the healer should be moved down to Farnsworth and below.  Would fix a lot.  But the tech tree and progression really need an overhaul.* There needs to be a ""Barracks"" that doesn't cause a morale debuff added to Tier 3 at least.  So that you can drop a barn, a Barracks, and any other supporting structures to advance down the map.  Allowing some form of short term large housing (10-15+ units).

TacticsNoob,158.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TacticsNoob/,"June 18, 2024",1,"I have been loving this game.  It has definitely taken some time, as I had to restart three times now.  This final play through, I really paced myself and have been running around fighting the smaller bandit camps.  The building aspect of it is fun.  I am not very good at the fighting side of things so I mostly just use the bow and kite the bandits/brigands.  Have your own workers makes the game that much more fun, giving you time to explore around and go hunting.  I have almost 150 hours into this game and will continue playing it for quite some time.  Almost to tier 3.  The first time I liberated a village, a huge army of brigands came (about 15) and destroyed me.  Second time, i built up a little bit  and got more people and still got destroyed.  This last play through I waited quite a while, got ready, and there were only four or five Brigands that came.  Now I am running pretty smooth.My only complaint is the tasks seem to be lacking and get too advanced too quickly.  I've barely been able to finish a task the past week because most of them require you to have apprentice of some kind (which i recently got a couple of).

As a solo player, I've found it incredibly engaging and fun. One of the highlights for me has been liberating the first town, which admittedly took a few tries, but the challenge was absolutely worth it.First and foremost, the graphics in this game are simply awesome. Every landscape, character, and detail is beautifully rendered, which truly immerses you in the game world. The attention to visual detail adds a layer of realism that enhances the overall experience.The gameplay itself is where this game truly shines. The mechanics are smooth and intuitive, making it easy to pick up and play, yet there's enough depth to keep you hooked for hours on end. Whether it's exploring new areas, completing quests, or engaging in combat, every aspect feels well-crafted and thought out.One thing that stands out to me is the sense of accomplishment when overcoming challenges. Liberating the first town was a perfect example of this. It was tough, requiring strategic thinking and skillful execution, but the feeling of success afterwards was incredibly satisfying.Another aspect I appreciate is the attention to world-building. The lore and backstory woven into the game enrich the experience, making the world feel alive and immersive. Exploring the lore adds an extra layer of depth for those who enjoy diving into the narrative.Overall, my experience with this game has been nothing short of fantastic. From the captivating graphics to the engaging gameplay and rich storytelling, it's a title that keeps me coming back for more.

The most annoying part about the game is the crashing and it doesn't have any real rime nor reason because it will crash on startup, in 5 minutes, in 15 minutes,  or a couple days. The worst feeling is when the server is up and running after many crashes and its made it over a day and you have to shut it off so you can update because auto updating friends want to play. All in all its an alright concept but it really needs to bake another six to 12 months and would be nice to have batch updates every couple weeks to a month but the daily update while great to know the Devs are still working on it does create the process where the game has to crash 50 11 times due to restarts and lose a stable connection due to update.

There is enough to do right now to make the $30 price tag worth it but the potential this game has in the next year or so make me excited.Edit: After about 20 hours I'm still having a great time. This game does a wonderful job of creating an immersive and grounded medieval experience without forcing the player to endure tedious activities. You have to run around gathering materials and crafting at first, but pretty quickly can delegate all of that to villagers instead so you can focus on quests, hunting, fighting bandit raids, etc. The learning curve is long, but it seems to flow well with a ""zero to hero"" progression style that so far has felt like experiencing the game in different stages.

You have to slowly build up your forces from nothing and overthrow tyrannical forces, which is nice that there's a goal beyond just city building and living as long as possible.Combat is pretty harsh, but not complicated. Starting off, a couple hits can end you, but reading the enemies' attacks isn't all that complex.I feel like I have to address the voice acting. It is AI generated which the Dev's were completely upfront about, and they claim it will be replaced with actual voice acting for the full release. That being said, maybe my standards aren't as high as some peoples', but I don't think the AI voices are even all that bad. They fail at emphasizing certain words, but otherwise it is just a small part of the game as far as I am concerned.I haven't tried the coop yet, so I can't speak to the stability of servers or lack thereof, but I can definitely say that the game would be better with friends for sure.Ultimately, I think this game deserves a lot more attention beyond what people assume based on the developers' previous titles, and I am happy that the reviews climbed into the positive to give me the encouragement to just take the chance because the game is actually quite fun.",Recommended,Early Access Review

I don't really enjoy these style of combat games because it ends up just being cheesy and constantly kiting as the NPCs just clump up and swarm.The game definitely gets better the longer you get into though. Unlocking new things, managing a small group, being able to equip your townsfolk how you like, assign priorities to crafting/working tasks how you see fit, and not feeling pressured to do any one task is nice. Hope they don't drop it like most EAs do.Came back to add:It is grindy, but there is a lot of content here to play through. It's honestly only getting better as I try to figure things out.

As many others have said, it runs smooth on any somewhat recent GPU. If it doesn't run on your Windows 3.1 PC, well, maybe it's time for an upgrade. Or stop buying games that aren't designed for it. Not every game needs to run well on your dinosaur. I know how much it sucks not being able to play the newest games because you have an old rig. I can respect that. But don't take it out on the developers.I like the core gameplay loop. It is the kind of game you can throw a movie on your second screen and just chill out and build a city. It looks better than Medieval Dynasty and I can actually (sort of) customize my character a little unlike Kingdom Come Deliverance. Don't get me wrong, it's not better than KCD, but I can customize, which is a bare minimum prerequisite for any RPG, asfaiac. Hard to get into a game if you can't relate to the PC.

At the start of my run I actually had a lot of fun with this game. There is so much detail & all the work & ""Love"" the Devs put into this shows. Of course there were a few things that annoyed me but when I started it was early access & nothing that bad to give a thumbs down.Now what did make me give this game a thumbs down? I can sum it up into one word ""Combat""!It's boring & feels like a chore... the fact that ledges & boulders are my best friend while fighting is just sad.I was willing to deal with it until something happened that I powered through but afterwards logged out & downloaded another game to play instead.What Happened? Well, I was in the process of liberating my 3rd town but had to pause to go defend another & right after march my army across the map to liberate before the daily mini army came to take back the ""rebelling"" village (this was extra annoying cause the army can be extra whiny when hangry) & while this was happening I had what was it 3 different raids popping up to take my own base & outposts. It was a nightmare & so not fun. I can't be at 5 places at once. I was only able to defend the town liberate the other; defend my main base & 1 of the outposts while I let the least important one be raided. All I can say is I'm glad I don't liberate during winter >.>.Eventually I had a chance to take a breath after all this so I paused the game & thought about it only to conclude ""Nah I'm done..no more of this crap"" logged out & haven't logged in again because raids & armies going to retake towns was on a continuous cycle that made me have to stop doing whatever fun thing I was doing to go ""deal with it"" way to often & I had enough... it was the last straw.If combat is important to you don't bother because once you hit tier 2 buildings & liberate a town it will be your life in Bellwright & it will eventually wear you down till you dislike playing this game as much as I do lol.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

It is being consistently updated but needs so much work. The main gripe I have is the belltower system. When you get a village to a certain point you can liberate it by building a belltower. You have to do this from scratch, piece by piece like any other building in the game. A large brigand party will come to attack you and if you fail that fight and die the entire tower is demolished in less than a second. Even if you run back into the town within 20 seconds to fight 1 brigand who survived, too bad, entire tower is gone. For a game that emphasises realism when it comes to construction and makes you gather each individual component there appears to be absolutely no regard to realism when a bandit destroys something. This makes it incredibly frustrating to try and liberate a town. You can't even make the argument to simply go and get better gear and more villagers because the best gear is locked behind the villagers who will only join you after their town is liberated (all apprentice classes). The AI is still broken, don't listen to all the people who say they fixed it, because they didn't. Sure, it's improved, but it is miles and miles away from completion.

You have to travel several times this way over the map to attack different locations.  Combat is just tedious micro management.

MacnAlba,56.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198046316480/,"June 26, 2024",1,"A phenomenal city building strategy rpg. It's very much still a work in progress but it's obvious that it's going to be a truly amazing game once it's polished. The game has some grindy elements to resource gathering but if you recruit enough NPCs and manage them well, keep them fed and clothed, they'll handle the resource gathering for you. Tier 1 buildings are nice and easy to build, when you put down a building area there's always a resource area where you can dump in the required goods then you have to click on a bunch of different dots placed around the blueprint to build up the structure one piece at a time. When you move up to Tier 2 buildings, this task becomes much more involved, every beam, every bundle of thatch, every panel needs to be individually placed and the required resources is much more realistic. No more gathering 5 logs to build a whole tavern, you'll need logs, wood, thatch, nails, rope etc. Your villagers will help you gather resources and build the structure for or with you. It takes a good amount of play time to get a tier 2 village and the whole time you'll be targeted by raiders so you'll have to gather your villagers into an army, command them to hold the line or rush the enemy. You'll regularly have to go on hunting expeditions to kill wolves, deer or boar to have enough food to feed your villagers for the raids or throughout the winter but the forests and fields are full of bandits and bandit camps who will pursue you relentlessly until you wipe them out. Combat is directional and difficult but once you master it you feel like a warrior. Stamina and health is determined by how much food variety you've had, if you have 3 different types of smoked food you're not going to have great health or stamina, if you've had some meat, some veg and a hearty stew (for example) you're going to have max health and stamina but you can always read some books to improve your stats giving you a much better chance of survival. Lastly the weather is amazing, while still a little bit janky at times (sometimes the dark comes on instantly) when it snows it comes on gradually and eventually covers the land, when winter ends, the rain comes and washes it away. Lightning storms in the night are beautiful, the landscape is illuminated in an instant with each lightning strike before being plunged into a deep darkness again. This game isn't yet AAA but you'll never be bored and you'll still be amazed in spite of the games few flaws.",Recommended,Early Access Review

You have to cheese every battle to win. Stat gain is also awful.  I give it a 3 out of 10.       The town management system is very well made. Being able to direct the villagers on what to do is nice and makes gaining resources a bit easier. Its also enjoyable to make your town and watch it thrive into something like a community. The developer should have stopped there.      The combat is complete garbage, every enemy (regardless of the armor you are wearing) can kill you in two-three hits. Simple weapons they use are completely devastating and rarely miss. You, on the other hand, are made from paper. The same weapons used barely do damage (don't bother using swords, stick to maces), miss often, and are extremely slow. I got to watch my guy wind up a stab for three seconds, then get pummeled by the faster enemy.        Gaining stats is also awful. Cut down and drag 900+ trees across the map? Adds nothing to strength. You have to either read a book on strength, or go fight enemies to gain it.

Theres a bit of a learning curve in the village management systems, but once its mastered it seems like youll never have to do any of those pesky survival mechanics yourself. One thing about survival games is the constant crafting, cooking repairing and building etc. Well not with this game. Once you tell you people what to do they will be about 90% autonomous. Which is awesome because you can focus on whats great imo about this game. The combat. I love directional combat. Its grounded to be slightly more realistic, but arcadey enough to not be too challenging. It easy easy to pick up but hard to master. I wish more games had directional attacks and blocks, instead of the boring button mashing. Instead of a parry you have a chamber, which feels more realistic and engaging because it keeps the flow of combat and is more in line with proper swordfighting. The graphics are also very simple but beautiful. The snow and rain and the sunny skies are all a joy to just look at. Of course its early access so the performance is very poor and is another games thats totally unoptomized because they just assume everybody can stomach DLSS. Its still playable at 1440 on medium ish 30-50 fps. Even if I set it to 1080 and lower all settings it will still dip into the 30s sometimes. Another clear sign that the engine is not using all the PCs resources.Overall id give the game an 8/10 as is, once they hopefully polish up everything it will be a solid 9.

I can see the vision you are going for and im here for it. I just have to say the pace can be like pulling fingernails. Currently, I am almost 40 hours in and have still not liberated the first town. My issue is basic things are very hard to muster up. As of right now I have a lumber camp that has cut down every surrounding tree and i am constantly waiting on logs or worse, wood. My followers dont even go get wood for the lumberjack hut OR the foraging hut. So as the player all i do is run around and collect wood. I am trying to outfit my camp with better gear as the bandits are now at level 9 and i got crushed the last raid. I have 11 followers and still got mopped. My point is please please please allow trees to respawn. It is slowing down the game tremendously. I dont even mind having to go and personally farm tin or copper because the pickaxe is always broke and takes like 5 game days for them to repair it even if i have the resources. I have many small things id like to suggest:Followers dont use arrows. All of my wood goes to making arrows which they shoot 10 at one deer then dont even cook the meat even though i have followers with level 6 cooking and its set to priority 1. Maybe due to not having wood available? Cant smelt ingots because of no wood. cant make straps because of no ingots because of no wood. Please allow followers to teleport with you. This game already takes so much time to traverse to create a network of sign posts to then just have to run from Hearndean all the way to the bottom of the map just because i want a bodyguard with me is brutal. Able to move buildings. If i build a logging camp somewhere and they clear the trees I have to destroy the building then completely rebuild it somewhere. Resources are already super slow to come by. This is a killer. Just let us move the place or when we destroy it leave the full cost of resources as a loot bag that wont despawn until a few game days just so you can utilize those resources to build another camp. I understand the intent is to have multiple bases on the map but I dont think i could do that in its current state due to the constant resource drain game you are playing. Focus on building up a food gathering cycle. Took me almost 50 game days to get stabilized. Anyways, MORE WOOD!!! small trees need to regrow daily, and the big trees should regrow every 10-15 game days. Or at least let my followers harvest the small trees around the base for wood. They walk all the way to the logging camp in another region because they have (some) trees. I am afraid to build a logging camp around my base because i fear it will effect the traps and the hunting from the hunters lodge building. love the game for what it is but at times is brutally slow and painful as I feel like the AI is not helpful at all. They are about 25% of what we need them to be to actually make the town somewhat efficient. It might be day 100 before i can get my group outfitted just to take the first town! Please, MORE WOOD!",Recommended,Early Access Review

Why do devs seem to make a game hard just by making one item very valuable and hard to come by? If that wasn't painful enough, the combat is very bad, making killing bandits, boar and wolves a pain.

Played this game before i played Manor Lord. Ive had alot more fun playing this game more than Manor Lord. The Fang,Antler, and Tusk drops seem Broken (in the true definition of the word). ive prolly killed over 30 wolves and got my first 2 wolf fangs. the game says i got antlers before but i cant seem to find em. combat is kinda similar to Bannerlord 2 which isnt really a bad thing but im finding melee AND bow combat infuriating. I have NEVER SUCKED this Bad with a bow in any video games. this is just insane. the only way i can kill something with a possible head shot is when what im targeting is charging my @$$ down.

My friends and I are still enjoying the game. Especially as the story continues and our exploration opens up more of the map. The combat is getting much more intense. The scenery is outstanding... stumbled upon a hanging tree while hunting some dear at the top of a very large overlook and felt momentary dread as WAY more red dots than i was ready for appeared on my minimap.Ps. for all you wierdos out there conflating the publishers past with the devs... just like... go away and find the next thing to trash on you nerds. this is good, go mald elsewhere.------------------------For moderately priced co-op game this is an outstanding product.The combat system is leagues above what most of its peers can put forward.The settlement management is robust and well documented with helpful menu elements and a codex that clarifies the elements that are not obvious.A small number of reviewers are being very vocal about broken AI of the settlers but either they have an abnormal experience due to some rare bug or they are just not very good at basic logistics planning.Here is what you are getting with this game right now for less than half the price of a triple A title:A large open world with interesting exploration and balanced, skill based combat mechanicsA serviceable plot which sets the tone and atmosphere of the game very well from the very start.Almost flawless drop-in co-op networking. (we had a single rabbit that was desynced between host and clients in 7 hours)A surprisingly robust colony management system for what could be mistaken as merely a 3rd person action sandbox.Above average enemy and npc AI with really impressive pathfinding for a map that can be deformed and altered.Stats and skills that feel rewarding to level up on either your own character or your followers.A well balanced and compelling combat loot system that often makes you want to risk a fight with slightly stronger foes.The devs have done well to draw upon the successful mechanics of other games across similar genre like mount and blade style combat engagement leadership or Valheim's cooking based health and stamina system and to some extent a softer version of resource gating the tech tree to encourage exploration and conquest. There is even a slight Rimworld feel to managing your peasantry as they have their moods impacted by the world around them like heavy rainfall or lack of food diversity depressing some of them. Alternatively, finding prospective recruits with synergistic traits and attributes to be one of your elite warriors feels great especially since you can custom outfit their equipment at an individual level.Even if the game never received another update after today i would still consider it to have a decent value.But i do really look forward to seeing this game improve and grow. hopefully they are able to make that happen this time around.",Recommended,Early Access Review

It's a wonder how this game even has as many positive reviews as it does. Combat is a washed version of mount and blade but just straight up sucks and your combat skills take hundreds of hours to gain just so you can fight a basic bandit... You die in 1-2 swings from a club and enemies lack any stam so they just endlessly block while having health bars as if they were eating the finest food the world has to offer. The food system is similar to valheim except food spoils in mere minutes, not even a full day in game, meaning you will be running on the worst food far into the game and lacking any health to actually take a hit.  Armor is pointless, weapons feel just... off. The inventory system is clearly designed to be grindy and rely upon the AI building system which just flat out is badly designed, with AI walking everywhere, getting stuck, and hardly being worth it. I've played a fair share of grindy games but this one takes the cake. I spent hours feeling like I accomplished nothing... I'd say wait a year but this game just has bad foundations and there is a high likelihood that the devs don't play their own game.I should also mention this abandoned their last major title Last Oasis to move onto Bellwright and legit said it was either shut it or move on to a new title, meaning their company has been going downhill. I'm sure in a year this game will be abandoned and shoved under the rug. I have to question the sheer bootlicking from the game's community that it's either bots or the paid positive reviews, because this game does NOTHING good.And no, don't say it's because this genre isn't my style, I played and restarted several times through Medieval Dynasty.

It offers an interesting village building and management style, Mount and Blade combat (skill based with directional blocking and attacking, recruiting companions) and a fairly interesting progression tech tree and attribute system. It lacks depth on the story / rpg side of things, but makes up for it on the earlier mentioned parts. Definitely worth a buy! Bellwright is a typical early access game; it has bugs, crashes (although I did not experience them after a very quick patch from the developers) and some janky animations. But it offers quite a bit of content, progression and interesting approach to a combination of different interesting genres (survival, city management/building and 3rd person action combat). Add a coop mode, and it makes for fantastic fun in the first few hours.",Recommended,Early Access Review
ace30016,132.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ace30233/,"May 3, 2024",0,"Ok so to start id like to establish that i have been playing games online since 2004. I have played everything from Halo 2 to dragon age to runescape to Pax Dei to many other titles that would probably fill up this entire chat with names. However. I have got to say this is the Best looking peice of garbage that i have ever played. Allow me to explain. At first glance the landscape looks beautiful. No doubt this game was created on Unreal Engine 5 and has the graphics to show for it. The worker system works alot like Palworld and the guard and companion system works alot like Conan. These systems are very early in development and i wont be too harsh here but it seems like a good system but needs improvements especially in the Priority system . That is the last compliment i have about this game. Now for the true issues with the game. First off and the most tilting of all of them is the combat. I swear whoever wrote this system really needs to find another job maybe something like Mcdonalds where all they need to do is flip a burger to get some cash. This system is by far the Worst in Any game that i have ever seen. Even Pax Dei had a better combat system and they are still in Alpha and ontop of that they have established that their combat system is just a place holder. First off id liek to establish that i have the game on normal difficulty nothing fancy just straight plug and play settings. So tell me why i have the best armor i can get with a Village Hall, The Best weapons i can get and no matter what i still get oneshot even while eating the best food with my HP bar being roughly 1/3 of the size of the top of my screen. I go to use mellee weapons against the npcs and 1/10 swings actually connects with the enemies while Every single one of theirs connects no matter if im right ontop of them or 10 feet away. If you somehow manage to parry their attack with the worst parrying system ive ever seen in a game relying upon your reaction time to no only click right click but to jerk your mouse in the opposite direction of which they are swinging to be able to parry them. Oh did i mention that you get oneshot if you fail it? yeah... Ontop of this the problem isnt just with the enemy Mellee NPCs its also with the archers so fail to zig zag 1 time while fighting 3 mellee and trying to parry them all without the ability to dodge roll at all because i guess that would of taken too much brainpower for the Developers of Donkey Crew who claim to have been gamers before their dev careers but obviosly lack the clear needs of most gamers which is a rough version of a combat system that has potential and works with only a few nich issues that only occur when x meets y and fks z. But no seriosly this game has absolutely 0 Potential in the combat department. Moving on to the Progression System. So we will start with food. while i have no issues with the stats of the food. the main issue that i have is with the spoil time of the food which equates to roughly 5 minutes. The duration of the food equates to about the same. so at best you get 10 minutes with the food from the time it is gathered/ Crafted or looted. With the combat system you will never have it on hand and if your workers collect it then you still have to cook it and travel to where you have to fight just to die to oneshot. Want to prolongue the spoil timer? you have to wait until late mid game to be able to access it. Some could argue funding is the issue but how could it be when they are backed by Snail Games. literally one of the worst companies you could have backing you especially after the unlimited Ark fiasco stories that was almost a daily story on major developer websites and game reivew sites such as IGN. I say this directly to Donkey Crew. Re-evaluate your roster. Cut anyone that worked on that combat system. Then hire starting with management down. This game should of never been released and personally i think that it is a game that is nothing but a money grab and could of been created by a solo dev new to unreal in 3 months time. Not a Dev team that has 11-50 employees at any given time and years of develement. This will be the only game i buy from Donkey Crew until they prove to me that they aren't a Comapny filled with lazy programmers who have absolutely 0 pride in their work and before you ask no i am not willing to work for you or anyone else backed by a corrupt company. Take your game off the markey and redo it with some time effort and pride put into it and then maybe ill give you guys another shot. till then Stay out of steam until you are trying to figure out why your game failed./",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

Mr.Syler,0.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrSyler/,"June 19, 2024",1,"Disappointing Performance Issues - Not Playable for NowI had high hopes for Bellwright given its intriguing premise: framed for the murder of the Prince, living in the shadows, and leading a rebellion against an oppressive regime. The storyline promised a thrilling adventure filled with mystery, strategy, and combat. Unfortunately, my experience with the game has been severely hampered by persistent performance issues.From the moment I started playing, the game has been plagued with lag, making it nearly unplayable. The constant stuttering and frame drops disrupt the flow of gameplay, whether I'm in the middle of a battle, exploring the world, or managing my settlements. These issues detract from what could be an immersive and engaging experience.One of the most frustrating aspects is the inconsistency of the lag. At times, the game runs somewhat smoothly, allowing for brief moments of enjoyment. However, these moments are quickly overshadowed by sudden, severe drops in performance that make it impossible to progress. The lag affects not only the visual experience but also the responsiveness of controls, making combat and other actions sluggish and unresponsive.I’ve tried adjusting the graphics settings, updating my drivers, and even reinstalling the game, but nothing seems to alleviate the problem. It’s clear that the performance issues are not just a result of my system but are inherent to the game itself. This is disappointing, especially for a game with such a rich and promising storyline.The potential of Bellwright is evident. The idea of establishing and expanding your own settlements, liberating the land, and recruiting others to your cause is compelling. The narrative of uncovering the truth behind your framing and leading a rebellion is engaging and could be a standout feature. However, the current state of the game overshadows these positives.I must also mention the community and the developers' responses. While it's encouraging to see that they are aware of the issues and are working on patches, the frequency and impact of the updates are yet to make a noticeable difference. I understand that game development is a complex process, and fixing such critical issues takes time, but the game should not have been released in this state.Until these performance issues are addressed, I CanNot recommend Bellwright. It’s a shame because there is a lot to love about the game’s concept and story. I’m hopeful that the developers will optimize the game in future updates. If they manage to fix these problems, I’ll be more than willing to revise my review. For now, however, I advise potential players to wait until the game is in a more stable state.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

Napoleenon,100.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198133806298/,"April 25, 2024",3,"I love it. The combat is satisfying, the followers are fantastic at automating the base, the story intrigues me. Review:Multiplayer-Played for about 3 hours with some buddies and had a blast! We raided bandit encampments, did quests, built a small village, hired followers. Probably my favorite multiplayer open world survivor experience so far.Combat - The combat utilizes directional attacks and blocks. You start almost no armor so hits take a solid chunk out of you.If you get out-numbered good luck! Make sure you bring your followers with you!FollowersYou're able to queue up tasks for them to do and they go from task to task completing them. They fight in combat and hold their own. I bring 4 guys with me to front line and i pick off enemies with a bow. QuestsThe content in the quests is great. One of my pet peeves in games is useless quests. This games quests make sense in world and some of them seem to have a ripple effect. The rewards for quests range from building trust with the town which i love, gaining renown, receiving items like exp books. TownsHave NPCs consisting of a Village Elder, some quest giving NPCs, guards, shops, and recruit-able townsfolk.FoodYou will never starve! Berries and mushrooms are easy to get as well. You can eat 3 different foods that give you health and stamina buffs and last for a variable duration. Without eating anything your stamina will be slow to recharge and your health will be limited. Your followers will be unhappy if there isn't enough food around camp.Ai I am not a fan of the use of Ai generated assets in a paid for product. That being said it's not a deal breaker for me.ArtThe opening sequence with the background story being told looks Ai art generated. Some of the item icons specifically the Bag look a bit Ai generated as well but i have not confirmed this.VoicesI muted the Ai voices. they were taking me out of the game and i would rather just read the text. Resource GatheringIf you're ok with resource gathering then we're different people. I personally have picked up enough rocks, sticks, wood, *iron, *iron+, iron++, iron+++  to last me the rest of my life. I just wish it wasn't so much. For me it's the small moments that add up when i need to light the fire to make food, oh first i need wood, gotta go chop a tree.. it just never ends. And in the beginning of crafting survival games there's a lot it! Eventually the Ai kicks in and does a lot of the jobs for you but they're a bit slow at the beginning (they have an agility stat that will hopefully make them faster) *iron can be replaced with any metal real or fantasy in a game, iron+ can be any upgraded metal like steel etc. i do not care.",Recommended,Early Access Review

For example, if you need to find a colonist with some clothing you need to upgrade, you have to find and visit (face to face) each colonist to find the one you want...there is no screen which will show you what a colonist has equipped. You can form a squad and recruit everyone to get a small thumbnail of each item they have equipped but this is a brute-force work-around that's completely necessary.Combat is still rudimentary. Delivery system is very janky and overly cumbersome.The quest system uses ""?"" and ""!"" icons for quest markers.

2005Guyver02,115.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/howem01/,"May 2, 2024",0,"Please note that my Review is from the early days of Early Access (2024/05/02 (YYYY/MM/DD)) will update my review in a couple of months.Please note that the game is currently still in it's young phase, with that there are issues: Bugs, Crashes, Optimization issues and daily updates going up to sort them out. Pro's:To receive raids, or not to receive raids: There is a raid system in the game that some will like and others that will not; thankfully the Developers had foresight and gave players the following options.After starting a game, hit “Esc” then go to “Options”, then “Game”, there toy can set the games difficulty. You can turn the raids on/off, change the frequency to low, med or high as well as the strength of the raid. Tutorials:There is a comprehensible Tutorial which has video clips depicting aspects of the game, with directions below each clip (though sometimes it's after the fact).Developer Feedback/bug reporting:There are at least 2 methods to give feedback to the developers. The first is through Steam Discussions, the second is through Discord (you can find a direct link on the store page).Graphics/UI:The Graphics and UI look good, it doesn't matter if set to low or ultimate.Sounds/Music/Vocals:The sound fx for the weather is a little overkill on the loudness, but on the plus side it can be adjusted via a slider.The vocals are a little low on some characters, but reasonable on others.The music is OK, some of it seems to be roughly towards the period of the game (think Celtic).Play options:You have the options to play the game in single player and or co-op multiplayer.So far I've played Single and it's been good so far, will update when I get a chance to play co-op.NPC's:In the game you have options to recruit NPC's in the game, that will help with resource gathering, hunting, crafting, building and defending your settlement (there are probably more, but I haven't gotten that far into the game yet). You can recruit them from nearby settlements (dependant on how much Renown you have) or as part of a quest.Cons:Standard Early Access troubles:Bugs, Exploits, Balancing, Items Crossovers, Crashes, etc.With the Crashes there is no indicator as to what caused the crash except for a long winded log file, located: C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Local\Bellwright\Saved\LogsGraphics:When in the main menu screen and in Options there are no issues with the graphics, including the loading videos. However if you have a high powered Graphics Card, you might want to go into the graphics card software and manually set the temperature/fan speed settings manually (the game is not optimised for a them).I have a couple of Red Devil RX6700 XT 12GB cards, soon as my character was visible in game/the game starts after the loading screen, when I first started to play the game; the Temperature shot through the roof, had I not gone back to the main menu I would have had Thermal Cut Out within 3 Min of playing. I quickly opened the AMD Adrenaline software, went to “Preformance”, “Tuning”: Disable Zero RPM, Enable Advance Control, go to Fine Tuning  Controls and input the following figures:Fan Speeds:   35, 50, 65, 80, 100Temperature: 30, 40, 45, 50, 60Then hit Apply changes and keep the app running in the back ground.These settings might look over kill, but they save my cards every time, problem is that GPU/Win updates keep over riding the changes.CPU/RAM Usage:Like above with the Graphics, the game has not been optimised yet, which can lead to memory and processing power issues, causing lag in some areas of gameplay, crashes in others and preventing the system of multitasking (having other programs running smoothly/at all in the background)Publisher:It's unfortunate, but the developers have signed on with Snail Games USA, which have been known as the Early Access game killers. I hate to think of the contract that the dev's had to sign into to get them as a co publisher.NPC's Building:Currently: If you place a building blueprint down then grab the resources for it, make the trip to the placed building and if the NPC picks up materials from boxes/storage before you drop them in the blue print; the NPC doesn't take them back to the boxes/storage if they are no longer needed, there by deleting those resources.Hostile Animals:If you decide to turn off the Raids, for some reason the amount of hostile animals increase across the map exponentially?!Fighting Mechanics:It seems that the developers have decided to force an omnidirectional fighting system on to the players, it's similar to the ones used in Myth of Empires and Medieval Engineers.Sounds:When approaching animals or in combat the direction of the sounds don't match. For example: You can be fighting with a wolf, the wolf is in front of you and the sound is coming from anywhere except the front. Other times the wolf can be to your left (out of sight) and the sound will be from the rear or the front; it makes Combat via directional sounds impossible and confusing; there will be 1 wolf and it will sound like you are surrounded from multiple sides.Hunting:There is no sneak option available in the game: You can't crouch to sneak up on prey or hostile Animals/Enemies, making you visible on approach and with the sound issue making it harder for the player to get the drop on them and making the player a sitting duck.",Recommended,Early Access Review

(it runs great for me anyway). THE RUPU KINGDOM WILL RISE!Edit: I wanna add to my review since I have gotten very far I feel. For those who are downvoting the game based on Villager food problems. I have all of the food woes sorted, however there is 0 direction how to truly manage your people. I created for my villages 4 cooking pots each village and a tavern, about 25 folks anything bigger you are askin for problems. There is a settlement system that you will have to mess with to separate these places and how they function, but yes its all in game to make just about every village function almost without you there for days. (Yes even separating the good foods for you and the homies they never touch the good stuff without me handing it to them or delivering it)For those downvoting or having issues with the combat, YOU ARE A PEASANT! Literally you will not be  1vX from the start. You also won't even come close to judging how to block multiple enemies with a low combat attribute character, after a while you will see the melee is so simple you could kill any of these guys 1v1 to 1v5. Just do not let them circle you, the slow in melee combat is dictated on your agility (acceleration/movement), use your bow at a distance (yes it gets better just remember YOU ARE A PEASANT!) Let me also say you are a peasant who has the capability of running a kingdom, have patience.For those downvoting or having issues with Wood and trees, Trading in the map after liberating a town allows you to trade for resources you do not have (this means trade every in game day for logs as an example) for resources you have a plenty. Don't just destroy a forest and get mad a tree won't grow back in a day...there are so many trade opportunities given to allow less deforestation and many other things if you take the time to liberate and keep these key villages liberated. This game has flaws, villagers can get stuck(space your places better), the bandits mass spawning, walking under water, and coop is great but if you have an issue just save and restart the session. It fixes just about most issues 1 go. I have had a good time, I know this game has like a 50/50 of being abandoned, but I can hope. It's worth your time if you have it(if you don't have time I don't recommend this game though. This is a not a quick fix game, but an enjoyable LONG venture of building a kingdom. )I will add more later but I would love to help clear stuff up those who maybe aren't understanding things. I do hope the devs create a way to show these USEFUL features from the beginning. Also to add almost all of my play time is coop with me running the server with 2 other main people and having friends drop in and out of my game to just have fun whenever they want too. (yes you can have more then 3 friends join, just 3 at one time including yourself.)",Recommended,Early Access Review

JediParagon,55.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/JediParagon/,"June 1, 2024",2,"Who ever it was that said 'if you didn't know this was in early access before you played it, you wouldn't know while playing' is delusional. This game is more laggy and janky than a lot of finished games. Take Baldur's Gate 3 for example. I can run that game on the same computer but I don't have nearly a fraction of the amount of lagging that I get trying to play this game. Maybe once I get my pc set up it will run better, but even with the lowest graphics possible it is still lagging an insane amount and it's very unfortunate. But, because I think the concept of the game is interesting I'm not going to refund it and hope that more updates or getting the other pc set up will fix the issues I'm having. However, it's been hard to decide the quality of the story because most of my focus has been on 'how do i get the lagging to stop' and I still haven't found an answer to that one. All I've really been able to do is speak the the first Elder and do a few tasks for him and a couple of his villagers. My issue is that the only place I have been able to find water reeds or whatever was in a pond owned by that village I couldn't take them. I've spent the enter first reason trying to find water reeds and haven't been able to for one reason or the other. Moving on from that, the sound is jacked too. I have my volume turned up all the day and nothing. And no, it's not just my computer because I tested that. I played a youtube video and the sound was perfectly fine. I hadn't even tried to touch the sound controls before I noticed that issue and when I did notice it and went to check them, everything was maxed. Don't matter to me if there is AI voice acting. Better than none, in my opinion, so I didn't have that turned off either. In addition, while I understand that this is early access, it's unfortunate how limited character creation is. Can't change hair, eye, or skin color. I am hopeful that these will be added with additional updates.Because of the lack of really being able to play the game with 3.5 hours on record at the time of this review, I can't recommend the game unless you have a superpowered pc.Edit: not long after posting this review I did find the river reeds... however before I could save the game or get back to my village, the game crashed.Edit 2: I loaded up and played for not even an hour before it crashed again. So for the time being, I have to step away from this game. Edit 3: After an additional almost 40 hours since my initial review, I do stand by the majority of my review, however I will retract my comment about the inability of locate the river reeds. That was to my own fault as I had been very hesitant on adventuring far from the settlement I had started. In a new play through with a slightly better suited location I was able to locate a source rather easily. I stand by my statement of the lag issues and have noticed it tends to be worse when it rains or snows in game. Edit 4: I have noticed that if I attempt to load a previous save while in an active game, it always crashed my game.

SO don't expect to be blown away by all this game has to offer, but it does offer a lot!! It is fairly basic, it does have some really cool features like army and abilites, & I think the AI do their tasks really well.If they continue to add more and more customization, bug fixes, probably re-balancing the game...I don't know their bigger picture so I might be incorrect in saying they should re-balance, add more roles/jobs, add more leadership styles, add easier ways to recruit AI, not sure if you can have family lineages but definitely it should be there so you could have the Great Grandson of your first warrior be your Head of Swordsmen and he is training all the new recruits because he has such high abilities/attributes associated with training with swords, and also like have a generator of more towns/villages or maybe even enemies, I read a couple comments saying this was made by AI, not sure if that is true but if it is integrated with AI then it can create more factions, and more people... maybe they already have all of this is mind, maybe they have even better stuff, as long as they keep EXPANDING (which I have lost hope in most games in early development, but I hope this one can be different...)Get this game, support this game, & now I am going to go back and play it...",Recommended,Early Access Review

After 110 hours I am putting it down for good.  Early Access means you are supposed to look at this with a grain of salt, and I have tried to do so.  But ultimately even with a LUDICROUSLY awesome idea, this game comes across very poorly.  Firstly, if you do not have a rig a very good rig >16 GB RAM, you will not have a good time period due to the combat, hunting, basically anything where a shot, block, or hit needs to be timed being EXTREMELY laggy.  You have been forewarned.  Secondly, the combat despite requiring you to realistically have followers to help you (per the devs), also puts those followers on a we will follow you but only until we get hungry timer (2 to maybe 6 minutes WITH food in their inventories).  Oh also you can use fast travel, they can't.  So IF you can manage to get where you need to go either to attack or defend be sure not to wait at all and hope you can finish fast.  Because they will drop their weapons mid-fight to go home and look for food.  Always dying in the process.Take Away, if this game survives EA and gets tweaked enough to be playable I think it will be top-tier.

Most negative reviews just gotta wake up and realize the world doesn't revolve around them. You adapt to the game and it's vision, it shouldn't adapt to what you want.If you like quick, unrealistic, easy and straight forward stuff, this isn't for you. Simple as that.No you cannot stack 15 logs, 30 wood and 60 berries in your inventory - because that's not immersive.No you cannot equip 4 different weapons or go around with 200 arrows in your inventory - because it's not immersive.No you cannot just sprint like Usain Bolt, because you'll run out of energy... Unless you eat... Because that's immersive.You're not a godly knight able to slay foes easily, you gotta develop skills and become better - because that's immersive.The only flaws/cons i've found so far is brainfarts from devs side, and i'm sure it'll be fixed. Stuff like food to villagers that has no real meaning besides making them want to follow you and buff them (they don't die of starvation), and their food meter depletes incredibly fast. It's annoying, but hardly a dealbreaker.The amount of bandits - it's medieval times, if you weren't a part of a village or city you'd usually be a bandit or a wanderer - this game has both of them but people suck at fighting so they'll go from in-game warrior to keyboard warrior instead.It's a steep learning curve and it's a time consuming effort to get anywhere in this game.

Your workers actually work on projects that you tell them to.Graphics are good and game environments are attractive.Combat does involve blocking and striking with a good balance. Player has to learn the timing of different weapons.Research and production of items is awesome. Love the variety. I love figuring out what makes what.Map looks huge and has a lot on it. Progression seems just right. Not too fast or slow.Overall, I can't put it down because it's FUN.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Glad they keeping at it and hope that if they can get some income from this game and keep putting in LO updates. The AI voices are always exactly what I was hoping games will start doing!

It's a medieval game that combines several games...it has nothing to do with Last Oasis or Medieval Dynasty, indeed the personal combat is similar to Last Oasis, but that's it, nothing more. The game is very well done in terms of graphics, with no graphical or other lag. The story of the game is present and keeps you hooked....you have to get used to the game, it looks heavy but it's not at all :)...I have a message for those who play Counter Strike or PUBG, medieval games are not for you, stop bashing the game if you don't understand it. The message is also valid for hatery.From my side, the game has a score of 10 for graphics/story/gameplay.Congratulations to the Donky team.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Yes it is too slow, but feels naturally slow.Yes the AI voices feel out of place (not that many times) but it is WAY better than reading the d*mn texts.Yes optimization, bugs and the graphics feel unfinished, but it is EAYes the character creator is worst than Valheim if made in 2010, but at least you get the hope of eventually having one someday (judging from Last Oasis it will never happen)It is a solid 7/10 with a good promise.",Recommended,Early Access Review

The village building wouldn't be so bad with all the micro management and worker assignments one has to do, it it weren't for how god awful the combat is.  You're practically required to speed track the bow and then play a kiting game because your first weapon is so god awful cumbersome and slow that you feel like the game is playing at 1/4 speed.  The game throws raids at your settlement, in and of itself not a bad thing, but you're facing 4-6 of them at a time and can't even take on 2, let alone 2x-3x that number.  Having a bow here is useful, but only if you cheese it by standing ontop your wooden tent because you can't run away any faster than they can give chase.This is basically Banner Lord, if Banner Lord was a Korean grinder.

There is quite a bit.  Great concept, great game play, nice graphics.  It's fun.  Now, down to the problems thus far.  As this is in early access I expect incomplete components and features so I'll list things left too basic and obvious placeholders that should have been completed before everything else.-Combat is lacking-Management could use work-NPCs suck at managing the base in your absence-Only fast travel and you must create the points-No mounts(weird) so there's a lot of walking in the beginningThe reason this is a problem is because the best spots to build are quite a walk from towns and quests and you can't build travel points close to any town/city and these points must be built by a road.  Making traversing extremely tiresome and tedious.-Animations especially involving combat need more work than they should at this pointNow for the reasons I keep loading up the game.-Base build depth, management and citizens-Quests and underlying story(Definitely basic implementation but clearly thought out)-Hunting-Story ContentAll of which have their own issues but well above playable.  Anyone experiencing crashes, learn to turn smart screen off and STOP using the NVIDIA overlay!  It's trash and crashes most games specifically those in early access.

Last night I looked up and realized it was 4am and I'd been playing it non-stop for 6 hours.Gameplay is standard survival-crafting, with a lot of nice QoL features, like your villagers having a Rimworld-like work prioritization system, skills that you can train up with books, or being able to set them to a Guard role and them doing their own patrol route pathing.The crafting requirements are well-balanced, and I never felt like I was being punished for choosing the wrong spot from resources (just from too many bandits or wolves).Combat is a little on the tough side until you figure out your food supply, because food is how you increase your HP and stamina (I *think* that meat increases your HP more, and plants your stamina more). You also usually end up facing at least 2 bandits at a time, so it's always good to bring a follower with you when you're exploring; being able to flank enemies is one of the keys to efficient combat.All-in-all a really great game, and I haven't even had a chance to try co-op yet.

Synseer,116.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198805599241/,"April 29, 2024",0,"This game is very slow Starting.  Initially you are untrained and basically inept.  Read books! every chance you get.  I suggest the Archery books first.  Read until you reach level 3 asap.  Then you can start branching out with other books.  Hunting and fighting was miserable with a bow until then. Fighting mechanics are sub par IMO.  the RMB block didn't work as anticipated... maybe once i reach level 3 or higher it will?  Fighting seems very clumsy so get some NPC helpers to work for you and be your companion as you fight things. Even at the low levels, they seem to do a better job.   The first brigands i ran into were in groups of 3 and using my club, i was clearly outmatched.   Additionally the movement is very slow and sloppy.   Movement during the fighting stage feels like 2 dimensional cut out characters randomly bouncing about on the screen.The developers could do themselves a big favor by creating quests which teach each player how to perform basic tasks, like gathering, farming, fighting etc.. Teach step by step,  not by immersion and trial and error. I found the controls very clumsy.  You try to pick up some herbs, but if you are not in the right location you swing your ax at them.  Try to cut down a tree, but slightly too far away, then you are swinging at the tree like you are fighting it.  Just wait a few seconds for the Herb/tree  icon to re- appears and try again.  Make sure to give your NPC helpers prioritized tasks to do.  Otherwise they waste time and act clueless.   Go to each new work bench, and create topoff limits for each item you need.  You may want to update this frequently at first, but after a while, you will get them dialed in.  Basically the directions and tutorials are weak and definitely leave a lot of room for improvements.Initially I found the only thing i enjoyed was gathering and even that is questionable for me at this level,   A brief tutorial of 2-3 sentences doesn't cut it. Additionally the movement is very slow and sloppy.  Bellwright is HEAVY in to gathering and farming materials.  If you don't enjoy this aspect of games, it will drive you nuts.  The game is slow paced and gathering is intensive, so you will need to spend hours only to have a raiding party steal you hard earned goods.   No building customization...... If you want a hut, then you gather 9 sticks, 2 logs, 6 flax and you make the same building each time.   There are other buildings, but all are pre-designed.  One of the reviews compared it to Enshrouded.... NO NOT EVEN CLOSE.   Its not Valheim either.  Overall with enough time in the game I am starting to enjoy it as my village grows, but it happens at a very slow pace.  Maybe a coop game with friends would help this progress faster and feel like one is making progress.  The NPC system is full of morons who constantly are doing the wrong job or working against you.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

wm.j.olson,93.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007295020/,"June 8, 2024",0,"Unfortunately, this EA game gets more things wrong than it gets right.  Perhaps time will see it address the gaps in thinking that make the game problematic, but so far the developers seem reluctant to make changes to their favorite toy.  With all the city builders available, many with a Medieval setting, their is a a tough standard to meet.  So, why should someone not spend the time or money to play?1.  There is virtually no guidance in game on how to make the various elements work.  Whether crafting, gathering, interface with NPCs, encounters, the whole range of needed interactions with the environment, the player is left with little or no information.  Tutorials are vague or provide no clue.  They might let you know that something can be done but provide no clue on how they can or must be done.  And if someone thinks that YouTube videos claiming to be guides are going to fill in for this gap, think again.  The majority of these are not guides are tutorials but showcases for someone's play style of the 'See me, see me' variety.  No useful information on the steps needed to actually do something.  A typical video will let you know that you can, say, craft something but then provide no useful information on how this is to be accomplished, especially since the crafting/research system is cumbersome and counter-intuitive.  2.  Speaking of counter-intuitive, you have to build a work bench and a research station.  But the player can't use the research station after it's built.  You have to acquire a worker to do it.  The game lets you know this but then doesn't provide any useful information on how to do this, how to get the worker to perform the various functions.  Lots of pages for assignments and click bait, but no useful clues as to how to make this needlessly cumbersome system work.  Really?  The player builds a research station but can't use it.  How dumb is that?  Trial and error.  Good luck with that.3.  Aimless wandering.  Let's say that the player wants to research and use a bow.  First, you have to research it, or rather have an assigned worker do it.  But you need lots of resources for something so necessary.  So, off the player has to go, wandering the landscape in hopes of finding the resources.  Oh, but some require manufactured goods that the player doesn't have, which need to be researched to make, which means more wandering for the ingredients or finding someone to sell the parts, which, if you find a merchant, the chances are they won't buy anything you have to sell to make the money to buy what's needed.  And so on.  With bandits, wolves, wild animals, and weather along with the problems of buying/selling making wandering a long and tedious enterprise, provided you then have workers to do something that the player is not capable of doing, means and endless, aimless, fraught tedium to do anything.  Rinse, repeat.4.  Oh, and while the player has to go agahtering over hill and dale, there are only a very small number of storage slots, which limits how much you can gather at any one time.  So, fill up the limited space and it's back to base, dump the goods in hopes that you've figured out how to employ them or a worker to use them so you can wander off for more.  Rinse, repeat.These few things only scratch the surface.  Because the game is potentially very deep in concept, while being cumbersome in execution, there are a lot more bumps and gaps to cover.  Good luck with that.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

If I had known this game had a food system like Valheim's, I would not have purchased it. I feel like all I do is farm food for stamina and health, and it's honestly really boring. Unlike Valheim, we have the gift of workers that should lighten this tedious load in theory, but getting to the unlocks I need so that I don't have to spend my time feeding myself and my settlement... well... it's painful and slow. Crafted items at stations won't continue crafting when you move away, you have to stand there and wait for the craft, and it's not a short amount of time. You can have your workers do it, but you'll still be standing around waiting for the craft to finish whether it's you or your worker doing the crafting. I felt like I was often spinning my wheels and most of my game play was waiting on crafts, walking (not sprinting, your stamina drains way too fast to sprint for long) to find food, getting food, walking back, waiting on more crafts. This didn't give me a sense of accomplishment, and I definitely didn't feel like my time was well spent. The food buffs don't last long enough, and the game play involved in securing the food is not very enjoyable and the trapping cages break far too quickly. I would have preferred a straight forward hunger and thirst system like Conan Exiles and other survival titles, because with how little stamina you have when your food buffs wear off, how fast food spoils, and how quickly cages break... I was honestly not having fun. I felt like I was working, not gaming. I absolutely love the ramshackle settlement you begin with, though. I like that there is a companion system in play and that it has versatile roles, but moving through the world really felt like a slog with how fast your stamina drains, and again I hate how food is done in the game currently. I'll keep an eye on updates to the game and come back to it throughout early access to see if this system has improved at all and change my review if it does, but at the moment, it's not for me.

EA, so not being too harsh but needs tweaks in village management & combat.  Still loads of fun.OVERALL (7/10) -> Keeps my interest - lots of room for improvements, let's see how it looks in 5months.GRAPHICS (3/10) -> hurts your eyes at first, then nbd.  Kinda like Valheim, just without the artistic feel or intention. Feels like going back to 480p after watching 4k.  Yeah, it's slightly better than 10 yrs ago SD, but certainly not the UHD we've become accustom to. (DEVS, take a look at Unreal Engine)STORY (5/10)-> (for those who care) Good backstory, bones seem good - once voice actors are in this will jump.COMBAT (2/10) -> maybe I need more practice?  High probability for (overwhelming) mob attacks.  You do get a ding letting you know they are coming and nice red dots on map to heighten sit. awareness.  Not accommodating out the gate, but unlike Half Sword, I don't believe this is on purpose or necessarily gets better with time.  Sending your meat shields only kinda works.  Getting up high and sniping with bow = easy winHUNTING (2/10) -> Why is there no sneak?!  Yes I know if I just walk directly behind the animal I can basically touch them, but man are they skittish otherwise.--So Likely another 10 hrs and I'll be ready for the next thing and come back in a few months.

BriteLite,43.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/devint12133/,"April 28, 2024",0,"There is however one big bug ive experienced. not too crazy not even a deal breaker (unless you dont know about it). but it involves the storage system and a lot of players are having issues show up in other gameplay systems because of it. So, it basically presents itself whenever you try and set a specific number of items in your storage chests/stockpiles. You'll most likely experience a crash while editing the specific amounts (main cause of bug/crash). Then the fun begins :). After you restart your game and get back in. You'll probably notice your crafting stations/cooking fires (your production buildings) are no longer working.) you'll most likely think the station is bugged out but it isnt. its your storage system. For whatever reason when you try to edit the specific amounts in your physical chests/stockpiles, it 'unsyncs' with your main 'Storage Tab': 'N"" ( for windows) >> Storage Tab (shows overall storage of all the items), mine showed the amount of '0' when i was looking at 100+ of the item in my stockpile. I can only assume the AI (your workers) are reading from the main Storage tab and seeing that you have '0' of w/e material you need and therefor not crafting the item or cooking the food, so on so forth. A temporary fix i've found was to build completely new stockpiles and move everything over  and destroy the bugged ones. you can still set the specific items you want in the stockpiles, just do not adjust the item quantities. you can kindve manage your resources by utilizing the top up functions in your gathering huts. only annoyance is with the farm, as it doesnt have that function. You'll have to utilize the Outhouse to destroy any excess you dont want. OTHER THAN THAT..... this game is freaking awesome! xDP.S.

Ginette Reno,179.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/blalbabla/,"April 30, 2024",0,"So yeah i am reviewing my review and i really want to give this game a thumbs up to this game and the studio behind it. I love this game, but its hard to recommend because it will fit a specific genre of gamer. I got a lot of free time recently so i can affords the time consuming grind that this game is. And the way the progression is lock ... makes me go crazy. But if you want  hours per bucks you get serve. If you like to tweak a village chain of operation like oiling gearing's you ll get serve, if you go trough the first 50 hours of chaos that his. The devs do patch almost daily since launch, but yeah i get some AI related bugs but mostly work fine for early access. i still doubt Anti-aliasing is yet implemented. And the studio answered my question at some part on their reddit. Big thumbs up to that!! <3So in my early review i said combat was clunky but you are suppose to be just another peon in your army. Dont think you are worth more. best thing is to gather a lot of villager and make them do the dirty work while you do the fancy work... or just watch them die for you, then come back back anyway. pretty neat after you get that.I was criticizing the exhaustive research and i still criticize it but not the part where you got to research everything cause that's fun, but more specifically the part where they made some technology incredibly hard to get. Which is sad for people who don't have a lot of time. In short, you need to liberate villages to be able to do research and the fight for the village is crazy one sided until you unlock those very same techs.....Finally, Stamina. Well i read a lot about this game and people complain about traveling. Horses are not implemented yet but if you ask me id rather get a cart cause what is hard is moving an army and the food that comes with it. Once you unlock fast travel sign, its getting pretty easy to go anywhere near a road with it.So yeah, worth the buy if you have the time to get trough a mediaval village simulator that want to make you slow grind like hell!Original review: KINDA PROS:trying to be the baby of valheim, palworld, and kingdom come delivrance. Not bad but yet its not enough to be praised. Graphics are not bad but very janky, lag spikle (like a lot of them), teterisation, sync dont seem to work at all. I dont mind really because its early access so its normal the engine not fully optimized but theres 3 Cons that id like the dev to focus if they would like a recommended review from me: Cons:-The crafting you have to do research for it. Exaustive research for the simplest of tools. i dont dislike the idea but some of the required tier 1 tools and armor per exemple need some t2 mats that arent available to craft before middle game. That a big NO NO to me....-Combat system is the same as Kingdom come deliverance and For Honor witch i hated with all my heart. but i dont know how they did but its worst than  any other game. Attack from a direction the enemy is not blocking ( but he will read you like a fuickin AI can read your tought) and block the attack in the same direction the attacks are coming from). Like KCD Its not a bad combat system when your game does Duel but it dont work in groups fight and its only group your likely to fight in this game. It might be something personnal to me but i dislike combat system built on reading 6 dude in front of me at the same time. i much rather combat system to be built on reflexes and timing than be looking at 6 dude and try to read wich side they strike while i got to block from 6 differents sides. its just so messy i went for bows wich i dont go normaly. and then the jenkiness of bow makes me mad also... because of the switch between shooting and running that take like 2 second, its impossible to kite the enemy, if you out run them with all your stamina (fully buffed) its still not enough to recover from running, aim and shoot the bow. They will be at you in less than a second. - Wich makes me talk of the last cons... Stamina. You just have to run all the time (didnt see any mount or transport in the game yet...) So if you gonna make a run simulator better make running fun but they failed that. Running take a LOT of stamina and stamina takes to long to regenarates at a to slow pace. ive  Eat my Stam food and yet always find myself struggling to run more, i have recover for stam as soon as the fights starts and since most attck and action dont take stamina ( just stop the regenaration of it ). The Jenkiness of this mechanics is faulty only because of the running that is tweeked to piss you off.So Not bad and easily fixable. Balance crafting so you dont craft ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff forever. Balance stamina but mostly the running part. For the combat id change how the Ai react to you swing and block so not every guy is tsang sun and add some reflex mechanics like dodge and parry.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Sure, you can gain renown through combat but weapons/armor are locked behind straps (tier II tech or loot from combat or what I'll more likely have to do - run around buying it). Speaking of running around, you quickly run out of stamina, which is increased by eating. Meat = more stamina but a steady supply requires a weapon.I can't even fall back on base building because you need to run around collecting materials, then run around the object clicking the mouse to construct it, and you'll be lucky if you get 10% of the mats back from disassembling.Update: To add insult to injury, I unlocked sign posts, which enable fast travel, but you need to build at least two to travel and it costs renown to build, so you have to choose between not running around the map as much and adding another village to speed up progress.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

But you're control of troops is non existent. Archers do not stand back, but appear to wade into the fray and get slaughtered. The melee troops all attack at once in something that looks more like a rugby scrum than a field of battle, it only takes one bad guy to have a huge steel sword and you're people are all dead.Add to this that you're troops have no experience, and other than spending a fortune on books to improve there knowledge, money you do not have there is no way for them to train to improve.Game forces you to liberate a village before you can get better gear, as the only way to get that better gear is to hire someone after the village is liberated. But as soon as you do, you get hit by increasing numbers of bad guys coming to reclaim the village, who again are better trained and have vastly superior equipment. I was unable to hire the needed people as you can only get them during the day and this occured over a singlenight.You assign people tasks and they stop doing it to wander off to get food, this applies if you are trying to lead your troops out to clear out bandit camps.

I'm giving this a tentative thumbs up because I really like what I see despite some obvious issues. Unless the devs completely drop the ball (which I guess is a possibility given what others are saying about them), this could be the type of co-op game I've always dreamed of.There are some simple but glaring problems that a lot of other reviewers have mentioned, like the fact that items don't stack in your inventory and you automatically teleport out of water instead of swimming. And of course, the AI voice-overs are a big no-thank-you from me (and I think most people). However, they say they are going to hire real actors in the future, and they better follow through.There's also something about the way the camera moves that gives me a bit of a headache.These are all things that can be fixed in subsequent patches though. I'm hoping there is enough of an uproar about the item stacking issue that it's fixed soon, and that this and other quality-of-life must-haves aren't sacrificed upon the altar of ""realism.""Aside from that, I think the graphics look great for this type of game. I like the fact that they made combat somewhat similar to what they did in Kingdom Come, although I imagine not everyone likes that. I'm excited to see what a thriving village looks like and what it feels like to command your army, or band, or whatever. Although I'm secretly worried about how this will play out because I feel like it could be screwed up pretty easily.I'm probably biased because the idea of this game alone makes my mouth water: a survival-craft game with quests, skills, village building, village management, and real-time strategy, all set in a fictional medieval universe? I've been imagining such a game since before Valheim came out.Fingers crossed that the devs do the right thing.

Fx3.髭男,1.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kbPotM/,"April 23, 2024",29,"It's meh. It's incredibly half baked. Janky animations: clipping everywhere, lots of teleporting (i.e. teleport mid jump to begin the cimbing animation)Janky voicelines: Sounds like they just used a text-to-speech program for 90% of it. Robotic, lifeless, monotone, and they get used way to frequently.Lack of control customization, poor optimization. Not a big surprise for EA but noteworthy.Combat is simplified KC:D style with mouse movements for directional attacks and blocks. I believe it's actually copied from their abandonware Last Oasis, but I can't be 100% sure because I noped out of that garbage game pretty quickly.It's also incredibly clunky due to the ♥♥♥♥ animations, and honestly feels much closer to an asset flip game than anything produced by a reputable developer. Unfortunately, it's also not something that can be improved upon without starting over from scratch so don't expect it to become better down the road.Other then that, it seems like a fairly standard, somewhat grindy, open world survival crafting game. It has a companion and city management system as well but it's not even worth mentioning.  I would have considered giving a more neutral review but I realized after starting that I had played the demo quite a while ago. At least 6 months ago. Nothing has changed and I didn't notice a single improvement from then. Taking that into account, as well as their tendency to abandon games and the fact that only two of their games managed to get positive reviews...I give an exaggerated eyeroll and a lol no thx/10",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

I'm not sure why this game was developed when there's an exact game like it already out and out for some time, that being Medieval Dynasty (which has better graphics, game play and combat). The graphics in Bellwright are outdated and glitchy, the game does not run well on my beast of a gaming PC, and the combat is... oooof. The gathering/harvesting system is torturous, why are you punishing your players?Perhaps (please God!?) they're temporary but the AI voice overs are just terrible, it's so immersion breaking and lazy.While this may be early access it doesn't explain the strange decision to basically remake a worse version of a game already available.

oxm,17.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/portocalam/,"April 23, 2024",5,"Yet another unfinished game. I understand that this is early access, but it's way too early. It feels very bulky and rigid; every action has a predefined path. Crafting is almost terrible; you have to add every item step by step, which is not that big of a deal, but you must be in a very specific point to be able to add said item. The combat hitbox is not great either; wrong angle => miss, wrong elevation => miss, same applies for gathering. The amount of necessary resources to run this game doesn't match the terrible graphic quality you are forced to endure. No matter what settings you choose, the environment feels fake, and the foliage is borderline terrible, if you look at a branch you can see how square it is. If the game feels bulky because of the mechanics, at least try to optimize it before adding further content, because what we have now here is a bulky game with bad optimization. This game needs to be more fluid, speaking of fluid you can't even swim, it will just teleport you back to land.Other annoying things:- You can't deconstruct buildings.- You can't cancel construction.- You can't research by yourself; you need to have a villager conduct the research, and you can't queue multiple researches.- Changing the research will destroy all the resources you've invested in that research up to that point.- Half of the map is basically barren land, with not even vegetation, just plain green grass pretending to be ground. The mountain biome is nothing but grass.- Hunting animals is a pain in the ass; there are no stealth mechanics. You can't crouch; you can only walk slower, but that does nothing to increase your stealthiness.- Most of the buildings are just a small rework of the same building (a wooden tent).- It's painfully slow to walk anywhere, and God forbid you're out at night outside your village, and the innkeeper is no longer there to pass the night.- The most annoying thing is that when you're deeply developing your settlement and finally unlock the Village Hall, you need to be far away from any village to be able to build the Village Hall. So now all your work is useless because you have to relocate to another spot to be able. So be sure to be far away from any village.- Clearing bandit camps is not even worth the effort; the reward is minimal, with the only useful item being the strap.- Sitting on top of a rock renders you invincible; the NPCs won't be able to attack you unless there is an archer.- Dying while reading a book destroys all the progress in learning that skill as well as the book, so you are pretty much forced to avoid any kind of combat during that time.- The quests are as boring as finding me X item and going to talk with Y person.- The mechanics of the inventory are trash; each item takes up one spot. Say you have 2 rocks; they're going to use up 2 spots. 2 mushrooms will use up 2 spots, and so on.- Fighting a shield man with a bow is impossible; it doesn't matter if he is in a block stance, he will ignore the damage from every arrow, even if you hit him in exposed areas.- Wolves will literally follow you half a map before giving up; it's plain stupid.- Your villagers are very easy to kill no matter the equipment, so think twice before throwin them to battle, especially if you have high skill ones.At this point for this price I can not recommend this game despite its potential. Is like the down version of Kingdom Come Deliverance with with Silkroad Online graphics and terrible optimization.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

Cons: Looks pretty bad, even on ultra looks dated 10 years (except for a few things like the clothing textures which looked pretty good), animations feel bad and just walking around feels like a chore, you run out of stamina in like 5 or 6 seconds of running. The directional combat is worse than mount and blade from 15 years ago and i'm not going to play long enough to try bow combat",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

The game has some of the worst graphics I've seen in 10+ years and it also runs terrible. I am constantly getting micro stutters.Besides poor performance on a game with poor graphics, the UI is terrible. There are little white dots over everything that is interactable making feeling like they made this game for seniors.I haven't played far into it, but hearing that the game has real-timed crafting and other grindy features that try to push you past the point of no refund, I just can't imagine playing this game for any longer than the 30 or so minutes I played it.Just want to say something else. I believe that EA games should be treated as a full release. You may ignore the warning you get when buying an EA game, but I don't. Neither Steam nor the devs guarantee that a game that is released in EA will EVER be improved upon or completed. So, in my opinion, when you review an EA title, you should review it as if it is a 1.0 title. It should be reviewed as is, not based on ""potential"". This game looks terrible and the images they show are extremely misleading, my character had terrible pixelated particle hair and the WORST textures I've seen on a model in ages. I do not recommend this game and NOT TO MENTION these devs have abandoned EA games in the past, just look up Last Oasis.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

The gameplay is very slow and there's no instruction manual included. The storage system is so limited that it's nearly impossible to save enough items to make a difference. The painfully slow progression really detracts from the experience. Personally, I'm a fan of mods, and I believe that if mods are developed for this game, they could greatly improve it. Unfortunately, I played over 2.1 hours, so I'm unable to request a refund. Given the price, I don't think it's worth it. I've been a gamer for many years, and from my experience, this game currently doesn't measure up. However, I've noticed that mods are starting to appear. Hopefully, within a year, the community might be able to address these issues and enhance the game's playability. Until then, the progression is very slow.

Never played a game that felt so pointless to do when it comes to combat. The arrows fly in all kinds of direction when you move 1/10 for common sense. Randomly die by invisible arrows coming out of bowman's body when they use clubs in close combat?? The 'defense/block' when using melee weapons is a joke. Never in my life have I ever seen swinging a weapon so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ slow without effort in actually dealing damage? Love the game, its fun learning how to play and navigate without utube tutorials. The fact that you have to have nps do everything is to ridiculous... Bandit camps seem pointless, the Ai attack/ run away/ infinite stamina is a joke. Food drain is absurd. Overall game is fun worth playing, combat is just a joke all honestly... Head-shots are not a one shot, aiming is pointless, dude in a shirt takes 4 arrows to kill like wtf? Arrows fly through nps and kill you? Aim bot like a mf. Hit box is a joke, they dont have to swing and you die? ""Sensing"" and seeing you get near is a joke, unrealistic asf. 5 sticks from a log? You ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kidding me lol? Chests don't re-spawn with loot ""bummer"" I would like to see a guard or something by defeated bandit camps not just a wagon/fire and then leaving it? You can accidentally hit nps with weapons when speaking to them, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying. Games entertaining, the best would be fighting, not even hunting is fun, just stand on a rock and shoot arrows. Doesn't feel rewarding at all.. Cant get close, blocking is a joke, hit box is a joke, died by a wolf 5 feet away... Game seems really ""tight controlled"" doesn't feel free when it comes to being involved in the world. Looking to keep playing maybe this review with change, but the combat is ass......1 week later, vastly roaming around doing missions. supposedly im getting to good, getting attacked every three days by bandit raids #10. haven't  lost yet. Kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when you attack a bandit, he notices the arrow before it hits him 100% accuracy btw... Turns, *arrow misses.... Get 3 perfect shots *head-shots btw, no damage.... I die game lags from not switching to a sword fast enough because they have infinite speed/ stamina.... Reload back in, 3 more spawn next to him?? Then i get shot with 2 arrows instantly, get damage before I can even move... I run I evade, I use the unstuck/ teleport method via river... lol I win a head-shot, they run. i get jumped by 6 bandits when I was ike 200 ft from their camp? dont know how ai can ""hear"" me from that far. That infinite speed/ stamina gets me, I die within 10 seconds, *landed multiple head-shots I guess they only do 15% dmg to skulls without armor or helmets but what do I know?wheat disappears from inventory, buy it, npc cant grow it in farms for ♥♥♥♥, seeds dont get produced, doesn't show up in storage in settlement, doesn't grow?  Spent almost 400$ gold on seeds of wheat, havent seen them produce anything, love it. Idk why but these ""workers"" cant gather sticks for ♥♥♥♥..Combat is still garbage. Sick and tired of aiming my bow and then releasing the arrow for it to NOT fly out... Idk who the ♥♥♥♥ is about to hit me, bite me, attack me, my arrow goes out. Stop with this coded nonsense, its like mortal kombat and not being able to get out of an attack without defense. Its ridiculous, a head-shot without a helmet is a instant kill learn to make things have SOME common sense. I go like 4-8 shots not being able to release an arrow and its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying. The damn aim bot on this game is stupid as well, my hit box is like a damn whale, arrows fly past me yet they ""gravitate"" to my character. I get perfect shots, perfect leads and yet the ai just moves or ""misses"" the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ arrow. Every game I have played my aim is literally 99% perfect. This game is coded in error. I have over 60 Armour points, yet i die in 2 arrows? 2 hits from weapons, yet it takes over 3 arrows to a guy without a helmet point blank head-shots? Border outlines of territory are false as well, stuff in my area is ""owned"" by another yet that makes perfect sense. Cant build on cliffs? No gates, walls, or good defense, just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wood stick fence, 100% logic there. At least let us build what is in the game, The wheat farm has like 3 different cool walls, why cant we build that? Just add an attack dmg for bandits and raids, after we can repair the walls. specifically tier 2 or 3 walls.6/23/24 less then month of owning, game crashes my pc. First game in ever to do that. Game glitches out after a load, after a save. In game rainbow pixels and map/ everything gets distorted like a bug/error in the code. Not sure if its from a problem with having to MANY saves in one map/game or what. Also extremely annoying how these follows cant feed themselves... A damn raid comes and they all leave to search for food. IDK how the games set up, that's bs. Aim bot with bows from 1000 ft away is annoying as hell to.

Ranged is the only way to go since melee is super ineffective yet. Enemy AI basically hugs you the whole time and there is no dodge or a way to get distance since every enemy has twice your stamina and runs faster than you. Leveling still needs a huge boost but its getting there. Villager AI is a bit clunky and frustrating at time with your people not following assignments or taking their sweet time to do anything but not horrible.

I gave up after killing over 80 bandits for the one camp.  This also makes the game most boring and suggest poor development. This issue also occurs when liberating towns.

Good game, but does have some bugs but can work around them. Have to say no to the request to mod at startup or the game will never start. Eventually after playing for awhile the game starts to stutter badly, but that is easy to fix by saving and exiting the game and starting it again. Game needs balancing and some of the quests are impossible to do, at this point. For example where is garlic? Also it does have lots of game stutter issues. Using the so called experimental threaded version reduces some of the stuttering. Why that was offered to be used later on and not the default is a big question as any computer nowadays that can play modern video games can do multiple threaded, and will greatly benefit from it. Never crashed any. Overall this is a fun game that is brutal in the beginning, and needs some work, has issues with stuttering, but is fun too once you get more developed in the game. It is early access, so as long as they keep working on it, I bet all the issues will be fixed in time. Do love this style of game. It's like a less chill version of Medieval Dynasty but with a lot more combat and war focus, so some Bannerlord mixed in. Hopefully also they make the female characters cuter. They are not ugly per say, just not able to be as cute as they should be. They also need to hugely expand the character generation options for looks that can be made. Only brown hair currently.

Told me to go build my own shelter far away from the town to ""prove myself"" before he would consider talking to me ... okay, so the writings not great, but I've seen worse. And who cares maybe the gameplay will redeem it. Nope! when I came back and murdered one of their cows as revenge it just disappeared, no meat for me to loot. But the town didn't seem to care anyway. Fine fine, I'll just go murder a villager. Killed one easy enough, and oh boy did the town care! Time to loot the body and get out of dodge... except no wait can't loot the villagers body either. Hmm, seems like not my type of game all the sudden. I was hoping for a bit more of an open world sandbox type game, whereas the scope of this one is a lot more constrained than the features would imply. Could have been served better with more character agency and less focus on a narrative railroad.

Yet another abandoned game from these developers.Should have known but i fell for broken promise's again.Graphics not too shabby.Some features were nicely done, like storage and its access.Combat janky and sucky (especially melee).However during its 6 weeks of early access release, patch's and news posts have dwindled from several small updates a day to 1 patch in 2 weeks (as of this posting) which had news of an news post will be posted about the upcoming patch and content tomorrow, alas 1 week later there has been nothing at all from them. Except all topics asking if the game has been abandoned have been deleted and probably all the negative posts for it also deleted. They are trying to hush it up in the hopes of being able to sell more copies to unsuspecting buyers.Now the idea behind the game was great, the actual execution of it is absolutely lacking. One would have thought that they know this but dont give a F. I cannot recommend this game as it is right now, especially when i am now convinced that its an abandoned game that will have 1 or 2 minor things done just to keep it from being pulled which would be minor tweaks. When developers go quiet and break promise's and they have done this with previous release's that they have abandoned but doing it in a much quicker route with this one, something has to be done. Especially after that recent debacle of a game. It seems to me that there are many scam developers on steam and steam has no quality control or protection in place, in fact it looks like they are endorsing this sort of thing. It must stop, enough is enough of this.For those like me that bought i would say hold onto you small % hope of the game but once that runs out, do what i have done and give it a negative review.

Tex Kreutzer,27.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198286259947/,"July 5, 2024",0,"Pros: This game fulfills that unique niche of village builder and intense combat. Villagers aren't dumb they get to work on various tasks on their own initiative. Combat allows you to swing from multiple directions. You actually have to feed your soldiers or they'll get too hungry and go find food. So food preparation before the fight is critical. Many tasks and lots of content for a new release. You need renown by completing tasks and gain friendship status to recruit more villagers.Cons: Some immersion like cold weather, water, needs to be developed deeper like Medieval Dynasty. I would like to see more trade options to build an economy, gold really isn't that useful in the game. Should be able to hire mercenaries or pay off raiders. There is little slice of life features, ie; like family and lineages would be welcome. It seems more like a war party focused game than a medieval sim. I still feel the need to play medieval dynasty because while both games are great but neither fulfills that one size fits all medieval sim immersion game with combat, economy and family. Also strange that religion is void from medieval games lately since it was a big political force of the era.

Combat is decent but when ever you face multiple AI its almost impossible. even in end game with higher lvl gear.Cons: Little end game content. Finally unlocked the last player housing but we had already beaten the game, I wish the bandits were more immersive in the world, for example if they could set up new camps and even have more raid parties around the map that you had to fend off. leveling is a grind and doesn't feel rewarding.wish you could have multiple town halls or were at least able to build in other NPC villages some how. wish there were more then just two seasons in the game. few bugs while p[laying multiplayer. traveling everywhere on foot kinda gets bland.

All the mechanics and features you always wanted. Its honestly a very beautiful game and a real pleasure to see this take on the genre. The map is absolutely mindblowingly HUGE. The tech tree is the exact same way and ever growing. For an early access title im shocked to see the amount of quests it has. There are so many other titles that are YEARS into ""early access"" that havent even scraped the surface of what this game has already. Massive props to the developers too for responding promptly to suggestions and bugs that pop up.You can just go down the list of steam reviews looking for suggestions only to find them being added to the game soon after. This Dev team is UNREAL in today's world. Cannot get better.With that being said though, the gameplay is quite clunky. Jumping over walls completely halts movement is one that immediately comes to mind as frustrating. Jumping in general needs some looking at I feel like.Also, the quests leave something to be desired. They are plentiful but, its basically gathering the same things over and over again which gets kinda stale. This game is pretty rough on the PC to run as I can hardly get it to remain stable for more than an hour at a time. But thats fairly subjective.The sky is the limit with this title though and I hope the devs continue the hard work.The mod support ""interconnectivity"" also isnt really there.

Gingerbread,38.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198299260762/,"June 30, 2024",0,"Good game as is and worth every $, but it has a long way to go. Team seems to be putting in a lot of work and heading in the right direction - which could lead to an epic game. I'd say this is a mix of medieval dynasty and bannerlord, with some clever ideas from other games.Examples: Multiple player built/owned citiespotentially exciting combat system (that needs ""a lot"" of work)have to build your own fast travel system (some people dislike this but I think they did a great job on it)wildlife and bandit system is pretty good, could be better, and my guess is that it will. Need more drops from both and more wildlife in general.NPC cities can ally with you as a protector - very good (golf clap)Even in current state has a learnable progression system for crafting and buildingGuard, mercenary, marauder, and bandit patrols - well done as is.Things that need to change:Currency and pricing (need to read a macro economics book or something - just yikes). Seems like it copy/pasted coding from early versions of medieval dynasty - dialogue, merchants, and item values are too relatable. Just badleveling system is too similar to medieval dynasty. If anyone on the bellwright team sees this then please change this. I and many others believe it was the worst part about medieval dynasty, it should not be replicated, and is in your best interest to change it. It is a very bad idea especially for a map this big. Badly needs a level cap increase. (30 or 50 max stat lvl)I'm sorry but no one reads books to gain str or agi. IRL they might read them to learn how to gain more str or agi, but sitting on one's butt does not raise these attributes. Dumb and needs to change. (Maybe add a 1 hour buff to str gain or give more xp/kill)Increasing agi or str does not make char better in battle. A LVL 1 AGI and 1 STR char performs very similar to a lvl 5 agi and 5 str char (lvl 10 is max). Hardly any change if any. The developers said they were taking on a combat system similar to bannerlord (which would be fantastic) but outside of the directional controls they are not even close. For example in bannerlord (with a max lvl of 300+) when you reach lvl 50 in one handed your char swing speed and damage will significantly increase. Not in this game - 0 increase.Mining needs rework - takes too long unless you have a village full of npcs. Which creates a natural delay to progressing your town. Some nodes don't produce ore. Also very few ores are found on ground and never respawn.Increase carrying capacity. If you want to make a walking simulator then do that, but need more space in backpack even with equipping extra carry space. Mounts are needed earlier than later if they want their player base to grow. Doesn't need to be perfect just do it.The Music is awful - equally as terrible as the leveling system and pobably the worst part about the game. I just mute the music.I have many more suggestions, but I'm sure the devs have their hands full. Game came out too early and could be a flop if devs slack. I do not know but my guess is like most other devs that release early access games, they may have needed funding or are just using players to do their jobs for them. Hopefully, it is the former. I do wish them luck bc they could have something special here and seem to be putting their hearts into it.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Hicks_206,274.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Hicks_206/,"June 30, 2024",0,"Bellwright absolutely captured my attention from the first hour.Not exactly what I would call a ""Survival"" game by any traditional definition - Bellwright really answers that burning question:Did you ever imagine what it would be like to be in the world of your Warcraft 2 game when you were a kid? Well good news, Bellwright is just that. An RTS game that shifts the players perspective from top down, to first person and takes on the design language of a base building survival game.I've seen snark in forum posts from people who do not own the title wishing to ensure folks do not pay attention to Bellwright because of Last Oasis. In my opinion that is a huge mistake.The games industry can be a very, very difficult industry to thrive in. While the fate of Lost Oasis is a bummer, Donkey Crew has outdone themselves with Bellwright.A title that delivers a unique, fresh take on genres that have been fairly stagnant, and does so in a compelling, and fascinating way. You'd be foolish to pass up Bellwright if the type of experience its store page presents speaks to you.I will preface my review with the following:- Bellwright is in Early Access at the time of my review.- This means you are playing *development builds* not a shipped game.- You'll likely see balance issues, odd bugs here and there, and design decisions that might confuse you.- These types of things are *to be expected* when playing development builds, even ones you get through a store front like Steam.- Bellwright is a game that is *very much* focused on pushing the player to utilize their NPC villagers to accomplish tasks, so while the early game *you* are doing much of the crafting and gathering - the mid and later game systems are designed to push you to have the work done by your villagers.- As such, the scaling of time, and effort to build T2 and above items, and structures *will* seem needlessly grindy if you are trying to achieve them *yourself*.All that said, I can not speak highly enough of what Donkey Crew is trying to achieve with Bellwright, and for half the asking price of most retail AAA games, you will *absolutely* get your monies worth out of the title.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Atko,42.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/_atko_/,"June 29, 2024",0,"After spending 40 hours playing Bellwright, I have a lot to share about my experience. The game, while showing tremendous potential, is currently riddled with numerous bugs that significantly detract from the overall enjoyment.One of the most glaring issues lies in the combat mechanics. My troops often engage enemies randomly, ignoring my commands to hold their position or sometimes failing to attack altogether when ordered. This lack of control can be incredibly frustrating and makes strategic planning nearly impossible.Bellwright is still in its early stages, and I sincerely hope the developers will expand the map and introduce stronger fortresses. The game world feels somewhat limited at the moment, and adding more depth and complexity to the map could greatly enhance the immersive experience.Despite these issues, the game has a lot of potential. I'm particularly excited about what the future holds, especially if the developers listen to player feedback and address the current problems. For example, bandits seem to possess an uncanny ability to detect my presence from great distances, which is quite perplexing given their lack of a tracking dog or similar mechanism.Another poorly implemented feature is the instant communication between villages and bandit camps. When I attempt to liberate a village, the nearby bandit camp is immediately alerted as if they have satellite surveillance. This instant awareness and response is highly unrealistic and needs to be reworked for a more authentic gameplay experience.In conclusion, while Bellwright has a long way to go, it holds a lot of promise. I'm eager to see more content and improvements in future updates. If the developers take our feedback seriously and make the necessary fixes, Bellwright could evolve into a remarkable game. I'm looking forward to seeing how it develops and am hopeful for a more refined and engaging experience in the future.",Recommended,Early Access Review

So this game combines both a town building game, together with peasant management and can also be played like an RPG. Really, really nice. To top this all off (for me) it has a directional combat system, somewhat like Life is Feudal. This makes combat for more engaging and less button bashy.

There are archers who just try to reposition for shots and melee fighters that just bum rush the target in a bumbling train running into each other and hitting each other with their swings. Early on you just fight solo and kite and shoot the melee in the face while dodging arrows. Over and over again. You're meant to use villagers as companions and armies. Awesome.

Liberating gets increasingly difficult and you have to take your army across large distances with a really bad food decay mechanic, they'll just wander off to look for food. The player can fast travel, companions/armies can not. It's really tedious considering the distances. It is beneficial to have multiple settlements or outposts but villagers aren't free and building multiple locations costs a lot in recruitment. This was ultimately my break point. They need to revamp the system. I'm a fan of time investment, but this is pretty bleh.Crafting is good but needs reworked. Wood gathering is particularly bad. Perfect example: 1 Sturdy pickaxe. Learned fairly early. Full grown trees yield 1-4 logs depending on the location you are farming. You can only carry 2-4 logs based on your unlocked bag tech. 1 log can be reduced to 5 wood. It takes 12 wood to craft 1 sturdy pickaxe. 3 Logs farmed to craft 1 pickaxe? Maybe would be okay if durability wasn't terrible in a villagers hands, you burn through these every other day or so. It just doesn't make any sense that 1 pickaxe that I can hold in one hand came from 3 full logs. It's dumb, tedious, and while I love fantasy games, I need SOME logic. This is something easily fixed, either reduce the number required or increase the number harvested from a log. This is just one example...this is pretty consistent. A lot of the crafting is outright bad, and it's almost entirely due to an illogical numbers game. Something that needs addressed but has not been as of yet. There are cool things to go along with the village mechanic, like I said at the start, it's my favorite part of the game. However, recruiting has ""ok"" progression. As time goes on and you make improvements to the villages you can recruit better more expensive villagers. Cool, but all the really good ones are locked behind liberation which gets harder and harder. Again, I'm all for time investment but the above issues make the game too boring to even try to get past a 2nd or 3rd village liberated. You have to farm A LOT of bandits to keep recruiting. Questing is somewhat limited. They are there, but tend to be based on quest items needing to be crafted, which are locked. I've had the same 2 quests to complete after my 2nd liberated village because I need to liberate 2 more villages to unlock the research with specific profession villagers. Long time off. I'm kinda droning on so I'll finish up, there is a lot of enjoyment from the village aspect of the game. Some tweaks there would be easy and much better for QoL. The other glaring issues could be more difficult. Fast traveling an army isn't the answer either. You'd steam roll the map in no time substantially reducing play time. Combat is boring and repetitive. The enemy just zerging and having zero brains is boring. I plan to revisit this game in about 6-8 months and see whats what. Take care.",Recommended,Early Access Review

I'd much rather they were text only on release, as it would be a lot less jarring.I don't like how we have to set our own priority list, even when the priority list in a lot of cases isn't followed properly or in a way that aids the player. The game should work in a manner that focuses on a gameplay loop and progression that players would enjoy - messing around with a priority system that the game should do automatically behind the scenes isn't even a gameplay loop - it is needless, beurocratic optimization.The combat feels far too rough, the city building aspect feels too lackluster, the survival elements inconsequential, the progression feels schitzophrenic and without rhyme or reason - all in all the game wasn't ready for release, just like 9/10 early access titles.

BlackAdder,81.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973597097/,"June 23, 2024",0,"Generally, Bellwright combines a lot of things I like:1. Customized base building - everyone's base will look different, and it matters how it's built2. Some overarching goal and story3. First-person skill-based combat4. Tech trees with tiered gates that interact with world progression5. Base-building logistics with gathering mechanics and build trees6. First-person and third-person crafting and equipment optimizationAlso, the world and a lot of the character models look nice. So I was really looking forward to this game - I wanted to take my time with the exploration and progression. But overall the game still needs a lot of polish:1. Logistics feel a bit buggy and lack quality of life enhancements. There have been fixes, but I think I still remember seeing idle characters that ought not to be idle. It should get a lot easier in late game to get clean logistics and equip characters the way you want them. If those capabilities are there, they're not well enough presented for me to find them.2.  The overall game progression is uneven. The more progression gates the game offers, the more suggestions feel necessary (in the form of dialogue or quests) in order to prevent frustration. This game is behind the curve.3. Some of the materials are frustrating to find and gather. The game seems to be suggesting that the solution is to put up more bases in the right areas, but it takes a lot of exploration to find later-game resources, and it's not always clear where the bases ought to be. Later-game tech and resource progression feels clunkier and less obvious.4. The tech progression isn't very lean. There are a lot of choices that feel like they were intended to be flavor choices, but they're strictly worse than the only very slightly better choices that very quickly follow.5. Base-building games feel satisfying if they are immersive. They should be beautiful, run like sophisticated machines, highly customizable, or filled with characters that make it feel real. This game's bases don't quite excel in any of those categories.6. Combat fits that awkward niche where the protagonist is limited in what they can accomplish, but group combat doesn't seem to make tactical depth accessible7. The writing and (mostly AI) voice acting are mediocre - they're there, but not enough to really carry the sense of immersion and accomplishment.After quite a few hours of play, I should be liberating villages, unlocking specialized capabilities, and expanding into new areas. But it just doesn't feel rewarding enough to keep going. I don't regret the time or the money spent supporting an Early Access game - but I do hope more polish is coming. I'll definitely spend more time in the game, if so.",Recommended,Early Access Review

I hope they don't go too much farther towards the Bannerlord part though, and gravitate more towards Going Medieval (best resource and job prioritization I've ever seen) and the combat system of Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Right now, solo combat against 4 is doable. Once my guys start attacking though, it just feels like I get thrown into a mosh pit and it's not that fun - that's what I hated about the combat in Bannerlord.

I absolutely love this game for anyone who likes base building games, people management, group style combat, and more. Is the game perfect? No it still have a few kinks to be smoothed out as would any early access game. The most challenging part i have had with the game is the combat mechanics that are similar to Mount and Blade (which i have never played) or the For Honor game series. Once you get use to the combat everything else seems pretty straightforward and i have seen several people play for 200+ in day games. Some key things i hope for in the future of this game would be to clean up some missions or buildings that will not give the player all the information they need to succeed. A tier two hunter building that only states it needs a bow and a quiver but also needs arrows is confusing for people who are learning everything about the game. I also worry a bit about the replay ability of the game moving forward, if the map can't change between each play through, or if the NPC's don't change between play throughs, then the game will become stale. My last note for change would be the Carpetbagger debuff on NPC's. Only being able to recruit 2 or 3 people per village for your main camp feels too small, especially when players do not have the gear to be travelling to the bigger villages in the south of the map. I would up the amount you can recruit to maybe 4 or 5 before adding a debuff.

The game is something of beauty, visuals are something else, everything I run is on Ultra with a 4070Ti and just looks amazing but please do bare in mind, you will need somewhat of a decent set up to run smooth. The devs clearly understand what they're doing and update frequently in my opinion with updates that are needed, which is excellent. As you can see at the time of this review, I am 58 hours in and going, this is also very fun with other players, I have two worlds created for solo and co-op, I still enjoy doing both. I couldn't recommend this game enough, the current state of the game is just so enjoyable as you progress through the medieval time frame.

Poiskese konn,322.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tanelsomeexp/,"June 19, 2024",0,"I've played for a while and here is what i'd like to see included in the game in future:* Boats (for fishing/travel);* Being able to modify cooking priorities of specific food types on smoking racks, so that villagers don't smoke all the available mushrooms when for example, those are meant for cooking Fine meat stews (tier 1 combat stew).* Production / Storage building (I'm pretty sure i have noticed that villagers sometimes add items into Storage buildings, that aren't supposed to go in there and then later return them into correct ones, dependent on what filters i have enabled in different Storage buildings) radiuses when opening Map. There are production structures (like for example, Lumber Mill, which has a description of 'increased range' or something along those lines, but currently, there is no way to tell the exact radius on Map). Same goes for Hunter's Lodge (and the one in Tier 2) - you can set hunters to gather meat/fur/hide/pelt in a specific radius (in meters);* Better quality tools/arrows (made from steel perhaps, to phase out necessity of Copper in the later stages of the game, which also depends on whether armor pieces will have durability in the future, since some of them do require copper ingots for crafting) and a crossbow as an additional ranged weapon as well as better visibility on the durability of the weapons/tools/shields (numeric values under the blue bar for example);* Additional wildlife (Bear, Moose, Mountain goat (in highlands)). Also, what's the deal with Demonic Boars? (i've seen a few of those in the marsh near Blackridgepool).* More use cases for Gold coins currency - right now, there is only 4 use cases for it - buy books, resources, use as payment in some of the quests and bartering with liberated villages. How about using it as payment to have someone deliver goods from one village to the other with carts/caravans/horses - makes the map more lively. Bribery? Hireable mercenaries (for certain amount of days)?* Activities to take a time-off/leisure time activities - card/dice games, catching an oiled up pig/piglet (when/if farm animals  have been added to the game). Take a bath in your personal house etc;* Ability to climb ladders and crouch when hunting for example;* In terms of CO-OP, it would be more beneficial to have a house, that could host all of the players in a session (4). Perhaps becoming available in T2?What would require attention:* 'Crafting efficiency/time it takes to craft an item' calculations (winter debuff is -30%, but sometimes you lose 40-63% or more of current efficiency - when it comes to farming in the winter, then that makes total sense);* Small Backpack should be in 'Back' slot, not in Pelt slot (Winter cloaks does not have a beneficial use in current state of the game);* For some reason, for example Fine axe is considered as a tier 1 axe, but Rugged axe is considered a tier 2 axe, but the cost to craft one, as well as damage output do not explain/justify this;* Farming is quite hectic - you either enable certain priorities on certain vegetables etc and your storages get flooded or you disable all the priorities and plant the things yourself, but let villagers till and fertilize the soil, water and weed the plants - how do the priorities actually work when it comes to farming?* When travelling with your companions (villagers), wolves and boars ignore the player completely and attack the companions first, even if player gets in their alert/aggression radius first;* Wild animals that are stuck under water can not sometimes be damaged by arrows, even if player can see a part of their body above water (hitbox/terrainbox adjustments needed?). Same goes for animals in death animation - an invisible box that blocks access to the carcass from certain directions is in some cases quite large.* Hunting deer in the early game is somewhat difficult - having the ability to hide in the bush would aid it quite a bit, but currently, it does not look to be working the way it should.Overall, i enjoy the game and it has a lot of potential.",Recommended,Early Access Review

I'm at hour 30 as of writing this and I'm just getting my 2nd tier buildings built (village hall, toolmaker, hunter).  I intentionally wasn't rushing, but still, you need to be up for enjoying the process, which I am.  It's my relaxing game after a hard day at work.  There are definitely rough edges, but its very playable and there's plenty of content.  There's also plenty to choose from to do in a day - if i'm feeling fighty I can go fight bandits with a crew of villagers.  or I can work on building my village or solving resource bottlenecks, or i can work on completing missions for the nearby villages, or figuring out what villager I want to invite to my settlement, or just exploring more of the map.  My big tip would be to build Travel Signs near every village so you can fast travel.  Also running on roads lowers your stamina WAY slower than normal, so that's worth it.  I wish I had a horse for the dang convenience of it but it wouldn't make any sense for the story or setting.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Was fun.SOME OF THE GOOD STUFFS:- A little choice in customizing follower's functions and appearances.- The directional combat system when it is improved in the ways the devs stated they intend it to be- Strong foundation for an immersive game- Settlers-esque resource management system- Some reward from exploration, could use more- Some realism in resources' location and harvesting- Some neat small details (the handaxe draw/sheath animation)- Skill progression system (action-based with skill books to booster)- Story has potential- Art direction seems solidSOME MEH STUFF (likely from being in EA):- Many mechanics and other things unclear/confusing- Some tools wear too quickly and repair mechanics unclear: (shovel harvested around 40 wood from stumps and didn't enter ""broken"" state but just disappeared. No more than 5 minutes of use)- Getting followers to feed themselves is its own mini-game.- AI collision and inefficiency. (my trapper did 5 minutes of break-dancing before clearing a trap)- Would appreciate more ""ARE YOU SURE?"" warnings for us Nincumpoops.  (I accidentally dissembled a stockpile and misclick attacked a villager)- Hunting elk (needing a head shot) feels bad even after some understanding of mechanics- AI voice acting distracting-ly bad (though I know is only temporarily! Still, it hurts).- Writing/grammar and dialogue MINOR WISHLIST:- As much ability as soon as possible in game to personalize the look of village, villagers, and own character. Finding things exploring or via random chest loot drops to add to aesthetics, like little trinkets or decorations-  Early access to paths or roads to create faster routes for followers but also lay a foundation for a village grid- As much realism as possible especially with harvesting (really feeling the axe biting in) and combat (the thunk of an arrow, goring strikes from slashing weapons, etc). It's not bad at all as it is though.- The little details are always appreciated.  More of what was done with handaxe animation with weapons and tools would be great one day.",Recommended,Early Access Review

But it was an entirely enjoyable experience.I only wish that there was a dedicated server option or some other way to more easily manage coop when one friend isn't online.===What I loveThe NPC management is very easy and intuitive, saving you from all the classic survival game 'chores' and rewarding management, making you feel more free to play the mission content.The environments are fantastic, the models and textures are very much at the industry standard or beyond for me.The combat is very bannerlord, and I like the design.The building mechanics are very intuitive and have that mix of granular building with convenience options.The mission selection is fun, and varied.The tech tree is Biiiiig and researching through it feels at a good pace.Music is lovelyBad/Not greatThe combat is a tiny bit on the slower side in terms of control, but that's likely cuz I haven't speced into higher skillsets yet.There are sometimes holes in the NPC management, such as when to smoke food rather than stew it. I also think that you get the choice of taking seeds OR fruit from farms, but the NPCs just grab the fruit? (I'm not sure on that though)Fast travel feels too easy, I would have thought it would need a cost in gold or something.The survival elements of food etc don't feel strong enough at all. The game never had the element of me going hungry or freezing in winter. I'd have preferred this be a stronger aspect of the game more like ICARUS.But the food buffs do incentivise u getting and eating better food.=======Overall this is an excellent title, I'm glad I have it and I suspect it'll eat alot more of my time.The dev team should be extremely proud.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Architecture: I hope that the building construction location will have the function of looking down from the top and attaching a grid line.3. Mounts: Horses, oxen, donkeys, carriages, ox carts, etc. can be used to move around.4. Terrain modification system: flatten, fill high, dig low.5.

There is no snapping for building things like fences, leading to odd large gaps between fences. The people you recruit to work for you are sometimes really stupid, despite being able to direct them to do what you want. The ui needs updates and just general work, and the AI voices are less than ideal. BUT, that doesn't distract from the good points of the game for me.

While yes the grind is real and you do have to do a lot of walking and picking up the same resources over and over to make an item that is just a little bit better than the one you currently have, those ""issues"" as some put it can't begin to compare to how bad the combat is. Now by no means is the combat so bad it makes the game unplayable, it just makes it mildly upsetting from time to time. For instance, I love to travel solo in these types of games, in Bellwright that's a death sentence. God forbid you run into 2 or more people you are dead. The blocking system is clunky at best and sometimes doesn't register my blocks. On top of that if you are fighting more than one person you obviously can't block more than one direction so you will get stun locked until you die. As of my 19.9 hours in there is no way to crowd control so your best option when fighting more than one person is to run as far as you can then bow them and repeat until there is one dude left. With that also being said leveling up your strength seems to be the hardest thing next to understanding the combat system. Maybe once you get past level 1 in the strength you can unlock these great weapons that make all my problems go away, however, the only way I have found that even remotely helps you level your strength up is books and blocking. But guess what the books aren't cheap and you will rarely find a 1v1 where you can block enough times to level up past level 1. With all that negativity being said I have only put 19.9 hours in which is a lot less than some other reviews but I'll be putting more in cause this game is honestly worth every penny if you can get past the combat part of the game lol. The story is great, the quests are cool and unique, and being able to build everything and watch your city grow is an amazing feeling.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Just because I have 50 hrs in the game doesn't necessarily mean I have this huge establishment or regime. There are a few things I wish were a bit easier on the game. For example; -- I'm hoping that there will be a mount or easier mode of transportation than fast travel via posts/signs that you make - walking from town to town or to any new location eats up a chunk of time. Not exactly something you can set auto-run and walk away from either. -- Along with that, the ability to breakdown an item and receive materials if an item is made incorrectly (primarily for clothes and weapons, etc).-- With buildings, you can destroy them but can't receive the items you built them with in return - which is a bummer. Makes building a bit tedious in the beginning and more challenging to advance. Combat is, interesting. The mechanic allows your mouse to control what direction you can attack from, which is great when you're a skilled or advanced in this type of format however, it can take getting used to when an enemy is sprung upon you or you have the wrong weapon out. It's taking me some time to get used to.Food/energy; I have enjoyed the longevity of different food items and how they effect the player in regard to stamina and health. It's great to play around with smoking vs cooking and combining different ingredients to make more potent/powerful meals that can help in a time of need.Overall the story line and quest guidance/advancement is interesting enough to keep you going and not become too bored.",Recommended,Early Access Review

DippyMD,102.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mvd9158/,"June 6, 2024",0,"Likes:Bellwright is a well developed game especially for the early stages it is in. The overall building, settlement management, map exploration and quest lines are exciting, well though out and do not feel repetitive. The combat took some getting used to but once you do it feels like Chivalry's combat and interactions. The enemy bases are great, the progression is a lot of fun. The research tree is exciting and well developed. Runs beautifully (i currently have 25 settlers). Dislikes:My dislikes for this game are simplified into just QOL. Managing settler's inventory is time consuming as each one must be found, pulled, and checked individually; yet attributes can be upgraded via the settler menu. Settlers seem to ignore Barns/Stockpiles/Check item specifications (I have 1 for just food but they still put tools, etc in it). Traveling from your main base to mid-late game locations take a very long time as your settlers scuff down food. It is fun to travel as a pack but not always, having the option to fast travel them with you would be huge. Hunters seem to get destroyed by wolves rather then hunt. Setting priorities to settlers jobs can be wonky at times as they may not follow them by priority, much rather would want to assign them to buildings rather then subjects to work on. Overall, the good out weighs the bad in this game and I much rather have the QOL issues out of anything then performance.",Recommended,Early Access Review

(Place a new building, they'll gather and process anything they can within range to complete it).  Returning to my city after dealing with bandits, or even hunting will have you feel like a lord.  Just drop your stuff off at a stockpile (configured to store nothing), and they'll put away all your loot in the proper places, repair your broken equipment, and (sometimes) even have dinner waiting for you.The difficulty can be a problem for a lot of people, but it wouldn't have been easy for a group of peasants to turn the tide against a well supplied Lord.

Aerofix,99.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198276969659/,"June 5, 2024",1,"Sadly i would not recommend spending any money on this game as there are so many others like it that actually have a decent combat system. the building in this game is really great and there's many hours to be played collecting items, questing, and building your city. however the combat on this game ruins it. you have to clear bandits almost anywhere you go and if you bring your villagers the bandits just wipe them out. ive spent a tone of time training my villagers skills and getting them geared up takes forever. not to mention they always put their F****** weapons up and when you need them to be armed the game just warns you that they don't have a weapon like you are gonna have time to stop combat and go re arm all of your villagers. secondly the enemy npc moment is so garbage that its really hard to lead a shot with the bow which by the way is the only good weapon on the game because it gives you a chance to kite the enemies. the npcs almost always randomly run past you or over to the side which is just absurd. There is zero dodging on the game so get ready to get tagged by arrows constantly when fighting. Also the enemies will eventually run past you with zero stamina drain so if you let them past you they just run to your village at twice the speed you can run since stamina runs out in like 10 seconds even when you are well fed. then they kill all your villagers and ruin the whole game for you. you pretty much have to bring villagers with you to fight off the bandits and just go ahead and expect them to die because like stated before the bandits focus on ruining the game and killing your villagers. using swords is pretty much garbage as the npcs will block almost every hit and the way you have to use the mouse to swing your weapon is ass. if they have a shield you are screwed unless you have a villager helping or you are kiting them with a bow. also you pretty much have to do only head shots after you go into an area where its level 2+ because the armor pretty much blocks arrows and you'll do like 1/100th damage to their health bar. but if an enemy archer lands a shot on you fully armored up it takes like half of your health. Arrows also take a tone of inventory space and run short fast.At the end of the day I love the building and stuff but the game is ruined by poor combat and npcs that just bum rush you so fast you cant even get a hit on them. be ready to get so mad as you progress in this game as combat is inevitable especially when  it comes to liberating a town so that you can recruit specialist villagers to advance into the T2 buildings. Due to this i give this game a 1 out of 5 star rating as the combat makes the game almost unplayable. hopefully one day the Devs will decide to make this game fun to play and not just constantly frustrating. there's a way to make the village raids come less but there's no way to make the npcs on easy mode or anything like that. also it would be pretty cool if they added gates so when you fence off your town there aren't just open spots that the raiders can run around to and come right in and kill everyone off since the villagers turn into vegetables with no brains and cant arm their self even tho you build weapon racks all over town when you get raided...I really like the building and making towns and what not so im gonna keep playing the game just maybe not as much. hopefully the devs can get their BS together and make the combat system in this game playable.

RaleighWill,103.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/raleighwill/,"June 5, 2024",2,"I found this game to have a really satisfying game-play loop: harvest resources to build buildings / do quests or kill brigands to get renown / hire villagers with renown to harvest resources to build more advanced buildings for you.  I really enjoyed Valheim, Reign of Kings, Kenshi, Mount and Blade, Manor Lords, and Skyrim.  This game has some of my favorite elements from each.  The big improvement from many of those games is that, in Bellwright, you outsource the boring tasks.  I'm no longer mining stone or chopping wood for ten minutes a game session.  Instead, I'm spending my time setting up my villagers to do it forever to get as much as I want.This is one of the first games I've played where I didn't feel the need to min/max my time.  I dislike that I speedrun many games, but can't seem to enjoy them unless I do.  With Bellwright, I actually enjoyed taking my time doing whatever I wanted to do (once you realize raids and reclamation parties aren't a big deal), without worrying about whether I'm being maximally productive with my time.  Sure, it's in early access, but I've already seen the devs address the most annoying bugs/gameplay mechanics.  I think to myself, I wish I could get trees to regrow; this population menu has two forward arrows, instead of a back and forward arrow; or there's a weird development choke-point where it seems like you need resin to create the thing which allows you to produce resin, *poof* a couple of days later all of these things are fixed.  Kenshi is another game that has many bad reviews from players with hundreds of hours played.  Who are these people spending days and days playing games they dislike or wouldn't recommend to others?  If a game gives me more than a dollar-per-hour of entertainment, that's fair value.  When I play a single game over 100 hours, it can probably be characterized as one of my favorite games, even if I didn't love every single aspect of it.  I still probably have at least 30 more hours until I do everything I'm interested in doing in this game.  If you enjoy building villages, managing townsfolk and resources, and advancing up a medieval tech tree, this game provides phenomenal value.  This game has made me re-evaluate my tendency to micro-manage/do everything myself and has contributed a decision to hire our first employee for my small business in real life.

Pipz,152.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pipulese/,"June 5, 2024",1,"This game ticks a lot of boxes for me and my brother, though it's not perfect so i'll get the negatives out of the way. Unlike what I've read in the reviews of others I like the way the combat feels in this for the most part. Perhaps some of the weapon swing animations like sword attacks are hard to read and block in time. my other complaint about the combat particularly AI is how they randomly seem to aggro and come charging back a few moments later. Of course I use this and other cheesy methods to my advantage as using an army can be quite cumbersome.Squads in the Army tab have some good management options like picking how much food they should take what types of soldier they should be eg: archer or footman. However you must essentially delete the squads each time you want to dismiss your army and also all the options you had made. It would be so much better if you could keep the squad you created but had an option within it set them to active or not instead of outright deleting it and having to create it and set all the options each time, if this is already possible I'm not sure how to do it.The other thing that I keep wishing this game had was a way to set the global amount of stock you have, perhaps an option in the settlement storage tab to put limiters on the stock your villagers kind of like in storage boxes will gather as it gets tiring to constantly have to manage your farm production etc. Speaking of storage boxes, the limiters on storage seem bugged unless you press the x on the specify amount and turn it back on.The other thing is the amount of crashing in the game can be pretty frequent but it auto saves frequently enough that it's not a deal breaker and you never lose much progress, maybe a minute. Though this does need to be improved. Tier 3 end game is where the game just fell apart for me. It starts getting very tedious to equip your villagers with new bags and outfits, placing the tier 3 Inn was impossible and frustrated me to no end, the buildings start getting huge and it seemed that no matter how many buildings I demolished for extra space it still complained about it.... however at this point my villagers already won every battle i needed them too and it seemed there was no reason to keep playing. Things start moving very slowly and all it's faults started to grate on me. I'm done playing this now as the only challenge seems to be me battling the games bugs and poor design choices when it comes to buildings. What I like: unlike other games of this type, I love to watch the villagers actually carrying logs and resources they've physically gotten from he environment, I hate when games like this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it and appreciate that this game doesn't do this. I like that the villagers can do pretty much anything the players can do and improving their equipment such as bags actually has an impact on their work, though I kind of wish they this automatically and you could also see their inventories within the management tabs. I really like the combat I think it's fun and rewarding to gain a new weapon and  armour to take down some bandits that used to give you trouble, overall though I can't complain as it is EA and i got maybe 70-80 hours of good fun out of it, which is more than i can say for a lot of games I've played.I still recommend it, however I think the longer you wait the better the more full the experience will be. This game is definitely a little rough around the edges and needs some polishing but for it's EA state and how early it's released, it definitely exceeded my expectations and I've had fun playing it. If you're looking for a deep colony simulation game in which you can also take part in the combat and defence and hunting etc, then give this one a try. I feel it does far more right than it does wrong and I hope the devs deliver in their promises to improve the game.",Recommended,Early Access Review

I was out of sync with the friend I played with, some things he could see that I couldn't on his screen.

Kafungalung,121.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198098557080/,"June 3, 2024",0,"had the game for like 3 weeks, dumped over 100 hours in already and it's worth every penny of the asking price on steam. That said it is still being developed and you know what that means, lacking features, sometimes game breaking bugs, almost no help yet on the internet for issues, unfinished and unhelpful game wiki's, AI voiceovers, grammatical errors in text, hilariously easy combat abusing tricks. I think the game scratches an inch that no other game scratches. It's a cross between the eating and fighting mechanics of valheim and the city management of a game like manor lords, that adds the rare ability to recruit your own army yourself like in the mount and blade games and it does it all in a medieval period that lets you use your villagers to do the base working like in palworld. its a fun game that needs a more repeatable reason to play or fun end game content to work towards, which seems to be lacking at the moment. I have probably been lucky and have only had one game crash in 120hrs so it's stable at the very least. it's a 7/10 for me at the moment as after 120hrs I have grown bored of it due to the cumbersome nature of gearing up and managing villagers and trying to move them long distances around the map but i am sure after a few updates it will continue to improve many other gripes i would have as the recent update has already started to address the user friendly features that need to be in the game.",Recommended,Early Access Review

The reason I can't recommend is that they mixed in combat with the game, much like other games on the market except the physics engine among other things just doesn't exist for combat.  To put it plainly, the combat in the game makes Witcher 3 look smooth and its not a 'forced realism' type of combat, its just bad. This game plays more like Alpha Warband with combat but cooks your PC while also looking very bad no matter the graphics options. Its rude to leave a no on an early access game but I do feel the need to caution people, this is not something that can be fixed no matter how much patching is done, the engine can't support hand to hand combat and barely works with archery properly. The villager/settlement building and AI management is pretty solid so if you wanted to just build villages and farm all day, the game could work for that.

The game has great ideas and it takes a decent amount of time to figure out how to work out the village management and commanding the villagers.What I don't like is that there's little to no reason to bring your villagers with you to skirmishes, as they will fall down quite fast especially early into the game. I most of the time roam around with a bow and just popping heads like smashing a watermelon. It's a decently neat game but doesn't offer a sense of progressing towards a goal.

Being in early access the immersion is sure to get some polish. There are some changes that would make this game really stand out ahead of other similar themed games to me: -When playing co-op, make fighting companions either able to obey a designated player or go with a group command - Make placing structures more intuitive, such as highlight the object in a different color that is obstructing the placement. -Let Strength offset the movement speed penalty of heavy armor and Agility affect stealth detection limits.-Scale out the Professional Companions to where Apprentice can be hired at protector status before liberating and higher skilled professions have more meaning in research/crafting since they would only be adopted only after liberation. It would help with the redundant hill of tasks before progressing adding some smoothness in game-play.-Adjust village workers to where they dont run away from a station after a task without the ability to call them back before they waste time to complete a task that is turned off in their priorities. -Add more advanced weapons like crossbows and flamed explosions and what not since we have iron and mechanical means in the game it only makes sense with the lore.

Many times they will try to cross half the map just to pick up 1 item while having 29 empty slots and 29 available items to pick up.The prioritization system is vague, it is much easier to set everything by default and just ad-hoc prioritize tasks than rely on the aforementioned AI.At first it seemed that the problem was the artificial blocking of items (for example. do you need 3 villages to unlock the backpack? while you can already craft iron swords, which makes absolutely no sense).It's 3 times harder to build a blacksmith shop than a liberate village where you build a belfry by clicking 300 times (wtf? who came up with that?)I hope you will re-balance mentioned mechanics in future patches.*P.S.I completely forgot, the fast travel mechanic seems unnecessary, without it exploration and rare resource gathering would be more difficult, and therefore also more interesting and challenging.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Spoilt21,72.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/spoilt21/,"May 28, 2024",0,"The map in Bellwright is indeed impressive in scale, but the lack of horses makes traveling a real challenge. Moving from one place to another takes a tremendous amount of time, turning exploration into a tedious task.Expected to see armies? Here, you’ll be disappointed. Instead, your ""army"" consists of a bunch of vagabonds more concerned with finding food than following orders. These ""soldiers"" abandon your army almost immediately when faced with difficulties.Your followers have a strange habit of throwing away weapons, resources, and tools anywhere they please. As a result, you spend a lot of time collecting them so nothing gets lost.Building a house in Bellwright is a real challenge. Each construction requires about 500 interaction points, and you need to approach and click several times at each point. This takes an enormous amount of time and effort in real life.Don’t expect generous rewards for your feats. Whether it’s a small bandit camp or a whole fortress, the rewards are almost identical and do not bring a sense of satisfaction.Your NPCs often behave illogically. They can get stuck several kilometers away from the base and remain there until you personally come to rescue them. Their behavior is sometimes frustrating and requires constant oversight.The game’s musical repertoire is extremely limited – only one or two tracks. After a few hours, they start to get on your nerves. If the developers need help with music, contact me, I'm ready to help.I bought Bellwright at full price, but so far the game brings more frustration than enjoyment. Overall, the game suffers from numerous bugs and requires significant improvements. Introducing horses and carriages would greatly enhance mobility and reduce the tedium of long travels. Adding a system for breeding and managing animals would add depth and variety to the gameplay. Expanding the musical repertoire to include a wider variety of tracks would improve the overall atmosphere. Implementing a feature to send hired NPCs back to town would alleviate the frustration of retrieving stuck NPCs. Providing more commands for NPC management would give players better control and improve efficiency. Making NPC inventories visible immediately would save time and streamline management. The current system for outposts and cities needs a complete overhaul as it is quite poor. The trade system is dreadful and needs significant improvements. Greater influence and control over liberated villages would enhance gameplay, including the ability to upgrade them.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Its EA, sure. But It should have waited for EA. Its a great idea being sold before it was thought through. You got enemies under the water, mind you you arent able to go in water. Villagers who literally walk away from fights because theyre hungry. Getting them to eat BEFORE a fight is a whole thing. Villagers who do anything EXCEPT theyre highest priority task. Getting stuck on trees, torchs, each other etc. Rules you can make, not functioning. Enemy str and raid freq being unbalanced. Using all your RAM regardless how much you have I have 32gb ddr5 and it runs at like 50k constantly. A whole list of things that need a ton of work.So why reccomend? Because they ARE (so it seems) working on these things! Bunch of updates so far. Lots of talking on discord. It seems like the rumor they released this to fund another game may be true, but theyre not just neglecting this game either. Its got a lot of potential and as long as they're willing to keep working on it, its getting better.That being said, the playable area is large and varied. Not super interesting everywhere but its there. It looks pretty decent. Combat is...well personally I hate it so i let the villagers do it. Its just a cluster of bodies and swinging arms.

Also, bandit encampment spawn rates are a little annoying, by the time I drag some of the bandits away from the camp and by the time I have taken them out, others have already spawned and I feel like it is too frequent and it makes it less fun trying to take out an encampment due to how quickly they spawn back at camp.

JonnyBoy,77.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013049402/,"May 21, 2024",0,"Game is excellent. It is definitely early access but I already think it is worth its price. The game loop is unique and very rewarding. Most the negative comments I read have to do with the developers history of abandoning previous games which I cannot speak too. If this game is abandoned it will be a shame because even in the ruff state it is in I am already hooked. Before going into pros and cons I will say the game is difficult. You can't solo many enemies by yourself in melee, and the management can get confusing. The difficult combat forces you to use your companions (or cheese the AI), and the management can get confusing because it is complex for a survival craft game but this complexity allows the player to do allot with the management system when you figure it out.  Their is a difficulty setting and it really effects the game so you can probably get what you are looking for but it isn't a relaxed game if that is what you are looking for. Pros:  - Companion system mitigates allot of the late game grinding in survival craft games but keeps the player involved  - Companions can do most actions for you, all production and tech can be automated  - Outpost system, its called an outpost system but truthfully an outpost has the exact same management system and enemy agro system as your primary village and their is noting stopping you from making and managing multiple separate villages.    - Liberating areas ties the player into the world and makes progress feel good as you gain control of the map   - Tech tree is way bigger then I expected. Great variety of weapons and armors and the compnaions have access to use all of it.   - Improve character skills through actions, allot of RPGs have this but I still think it is the right way level up your character  - Directional combat system that effects light and heavy attacks, as well as blocking with out a shield. Blocking is really cool when you get the hang of it, before that you will hate it. Most games like this have just a light attack and heavy attack so this really made the game stand out for me because the combat was so much more engaging.   - construction process looks neat when you watch it. The building layouts are predetermined but you or your companions have to place the pieces in order so it looks like it is being built. Cons:    - definitely can cheese the AI like most games, easiest way right now is that the AI can't vault so if you find a wall and jump it you can shoot at them as they run around.     - AIs pathing gets stuck on object. The game will unstuck them by resetting them in a nearby area so it doesn't break the game but it looks bad.   - AI is really aggressive in combat but will then randomly disengage run away and then come back    - Archery is OP like most medieval games",Recommended,Early Access Review
gloriousone1987,260.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199192407217/,"May 21, 2024",0,"I am nearly 260 hours in and I am hoping for new updates that will increase the overall playing time. I've researched and built all buildings Tier 3(Max). I focused more on the building and development of a settlement than rather completing the story. I only liberated three cities in this time, I have explored most of the map and was even able to get onto a large landmass all the way to the left of the map, which seems undeveloped(maybe a future update). I recruited over 30 people, set up one main Large settlement and four Outposts to transfer resources to the main.A few things that need fixed:As far as building the actual structures the first tier just requires you to gather all the needed resources and then click all the ""building dots"" and abra kadabra...But once you get to tier 2 and 3 you need a carpenters hammer item, which is easily made, however the annoying thing is you have a nail hammering animation after clicking every dot, which is cool the first couple times you do it, makes you feel like your actually doing something, but then it becomes super annoying especially if none of your residents are helping you, I've spent 4 in game days clicking and watching, because none of my 30 residents would help even though I have 10 hammers sitting in the warehouse for them and their priorities on labor( more on AI later) Each building does have a priority button which you can designate its importance 1-9 and also the items that building produces or will produce.Some buildings do require a skill level to be operated by your residents for instance a bakery I believe you need a lvl 6 cooking skill to operate, so If you have no one who is lvl 6 at cooking then the building will sit useless.The game seriously lacks defensive buildings, you get a guard stand, which no guard actually uses, its only use is a alert system to let you know how many Brigands or Raiders are coming to raid when they are close. The only other defensive building is a Tier 1 wood fence, which you have to place in small sections and have no option of a gate or opening, you can put the sections side to side and make a nice fenced in area, the enemy AI do not jump overs fences or destroy them and will just stand there constantly bumping into the fence trying to get to you(More on AI later) This is also a issue for your residents as they will do the same thing, so you have to leave openings in your fence to allow them to hunt,gather,mine, and so on, otherwise its a prison and lemmings walking endlessly into a wall. It would also be nice if there was some upgrades for the fence and guard tower.Combat can be a little sloppy, it does annoy me that you only have 3 weapons slots, two for smaller weapons and one for either a 2 handed weapon,bow, or shield. Most games I like to use a 2 handed weapon and a bow, and unless your going to swap weapons manually mid combat, you can only use a one handed weapon without a shield, and you cannot duel wield two one handed weapons, so basically you have two slots for weapons. I understand maybe not allowing a shield and bow to be held at once but a 2 handed weapon and a bow seems okay to me.AI:Here is where the game needs some extreme work... The most annoying AI to me is when setting up parties with your companions. There is a item called a weapon rack, and their is also storage systems such as a food cellar and warehouses that have food and weapon items. The weapon rack even states its used for villages to  gather weapons when getting ready for combat or when you set a alert for your reserves to guard the settlement, however the AI does not gather their own weapons nor food and you get these annoying messages instantly  saying that your companion is going to stop following you as they are hungry, you will see icons on their picture stating they are hungry or need weapons. You have to basically order them to one spot and then manually load them up with weapons and food before each battle or raid. This is absolutley horrible and time consuming, these are things the AI can do themeselve's, this is the most unenjoyable part for me. Its even more annoying because each companion has their own skill lvl, so each one has different power,agility,and weapons skills which means they can only hold certain weapons and weapon lvls, so even if you make weapons specifically for each companion, perhaps you want one to be a archer or one to be a 2 handed berserker, after ending the party most of the time they will remove the weapons and just randomly drop them in one of the warehouses, they don't put them back on the rack or put them back on the next time you start a war party. So you have to constantly find the right weapons for them to carry again each and every time you make a party. This should be fixed so they grab their own weapons again, if one breaks or needs replaced, okay let me know you need a weapon then, but the AI should be more intelligent, they should be able to feed and resupply food automatically especially when they have all the supplies available to them. You have to babysit the AI to each and every destination, you can order them on the map screen to go to a certain place or to come wherever you are, but unless you meetup with them first to supply them, than more than likely 90% of them will abandon the order because of lack of food or will showup with no weapons and get slaughtered or run away.As far as companion commands you have three- Follow,Hold, and a destination command. I have no complaints about that, if they have  a bow they will use it, when a enemy comes close they switch to their single handed weapons and fight. All the commands seem to work fine. If you have then on hold and tell them to go somewhere they will run to that destination if you don't have then on hold they will run after or chase any enemy they come into contact with. When they are set to guards in your outpost/settlement they will just randomly walk around your settlement, and not even together but separately and i'm not sure how effective this is, as they will find the herd of enemies and run into them alone without any type of strategy, its pretty much worse to make them guards because of this reason, it would make sense if you didnt already know where the enemy was coming from, but clearly you can see the red marker on the map and then the enemy indicator dots once they are near, so for them to wander randomly and not alert the rest of the residents to ball up for a battle before running hopelessly to their deaths. Again you have to babysit the AI for every battle or defense, which makes guards or reserves pointless, and also when you press the settlement alert and tell the reserves to respond, it acts as though your in a party and will give you the annoying messages that they are hungry and stopped following you or without weapons, instead of them arming and preparing to protect themselves, This needs fixed!villagers/companions/enemies all get stuck and cant figure out how to get around structures. I've had villagers spend whole days and nights stuck and bumping into a building, not going around it or figuring out a new path, just walking into objects. sort of like the enemy AI with the closed off Fences, they don't destroy the fence or run away, they stand their walking into it. The only way I can fix a villager is to either demolish the building or add them as a companion and set them to follow me and then once I move them away end the party.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Want to experience the real struggle of medieval life without actually having to time-travel? Well, step right up to Bellwright - the game that turns your dreams of hardship into a comedic reality!Picture this: You, a humble peasant armed with nothing but a wooden club and a dream, set out to build your very own medieval town. But wait, there's a catch! You'll have to do it with the most minimal tools imaginable, like seriously minimal. We're talking about using sticks and stones while your neighbors flaunt their fancy swords and armor. But don't worry, you cant pick them up! No shortcuts in the peasant life!The game starts with you trying to build a simple shack, but oh boy, even that's a struggle. Want to chop down a tree? You need an axe. Then you need to carry the log to the cabin outline. THEN you need sticks! But wait, there is more! Once the simple abode is build the next tier of equipment is where the game truly shines. Have you ever wanted to actually FEEL like you are building a barn? Look no further! Every rope must be places, every board nailed, every beam set in place. Your peasants will help (unless they are hungry) because life in the peasant realm stops when you need a little snicky snack! Once you get all the beams set, the walls appear! Time to hammer away! Tap tap tap! My god, the white dots. when do they end?But amidst all the chaos and frustration, there's a strange satisfaction in watching your little peasant defy the odds and, against all logic, somehow manage to erect a ramshackle abode. It may not be Buckingham Palace, but hey, it's yours!So if you're ready to trade in your epic quests for some good old-fashioned peasantry problems, Bellwright is the game for you.",Recommended,Early Access Review

mehuge,107.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mehuge/,"May 19, 2024",2,"Infuriatingly difficult and full of quit points.Still trying to liberate my first village, with 100 hours played. I liberate it, it is retaken the next day. The reclamation party of 8, annihilates my reasonably (as high equipment as my skill allows) equipped villagers turned army in 10 seconds flat, I can't manage 8 hardcore reclamation foes all by myself even with clever use of fences and stockpile for elevation, those archers are deadly when they hit.They ignored me anyway, went into Haerndean and reclaimed it instantly.  There's no defending against that. The only way to tackle a reclamation party that I can see is to attack them as they leave their base and start their journey to your town. Even if you defeat them (as I managed once picking them off one by one), they will regroup and come back later.Resigned to having to level more, I need better armour, raw hide is needed, I have 100s of hides to make rawhide but I also need a drying frame, which requires an apprentice labourer, but apprentice labourers are not available until you liberate higher tier villages, which needs higher level gear.Undeterred I set forth to Blackridgepool, where I spot a lady labourer, and pick up some quests to start earning the rep needed to unlock her.  First quest, I need to tackle a bandit camp, no problem I thought, I have dealt with bandit camps before (tier 1 and tier 2 and even some tier 3).But this one is manned by 20ish bandits, my bandit camp defeating skills are not up to that. Even if I could bring my 8 under equipped villagers (they can't use teleports I would have to run there, and its the opposite side of the map and they are slow at following) they would be annihilated in 0.2 seconds flat so what would be the point.Attempting this solo using strategic fencing I lasted about 5 seconds before being 1 shot by an archer. This is a quit point for me. Progression should not be this difficult.Food is annoying. It deteriorates so fast there is rarely enough of it.Villagers are disobedient, and lazy often refusing to work.Building management takes some getting used to, its important to group your buildings into outposts, something the game doesn't really tell you and its a bit cumbersome to do.The enemy AI is dreadful, it basically consists of B-line for the target, so they end up focus killing whatever they chose attack.Combat is not great. Mele is awful. The system of swiping from left right top or jab with whatever weapon you have is hit and miss, mostly miss.  Archery is ok, but when being B-lined becomes very difficult to kill anything before getting killed.Stamina system would be fine, if your food had not rotted by time you needed to use it.Villagers in army mode, are, to no surprise, disobedient. Despite equipping one with a bow, arrows and setting them to prefer bow, they instantly charged in with their fists and got insta gibbed. Why? I gave you a bow and told you to use it!I found myself at the point of saying, what's the point of sinking any more time into this game.A quit point.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

Other mechanics are present as well, such as reputations with existing settlements and a storyline. It seemed a little hard for me to get into at first, but now that I have some people doing tasks it's a lot more enjoyable. I appreciate that raids will not completely mess you up, bandits just knock you and your followers out and steal some stuff before leaving. The AI voices are a little off-putting sometimes, but honestly way better than having no dialogue at all. Of course this game is still in its early stages.

A lot of things are on the right way, a lot of things still needs to be improved.The game is EA and actually less than a month in Early Access. The developer did around 15 patches until now and there are already people who say it is abandoned. Yes, Donkey Crew, but as far as I can see, they work on it. They react to feedback and implement it (personel experience).Medieval setting, you are the hero, the one and only, the choosen one. Means everything normal. You come back to your origins. Now you must earn the trust of people, build up your camp or later your village and hire NPCs to help you, fight for you and work for you. You must do research to get better buildings, better tools, better armour, better weapons and you can fully equip your servant NPCs. You can fight against bandits, wolves, boars and finally against the conquerors of the map. You can free the villages and defend them.The map is adequately large. I like giant maps, so... but it is ok. The game works, I never had a crash (over 90 hours) - yes, I wrote never and I mean never. There are bugs, of course, remember, early access, but I didn't stumble over any dealbreaking one. The game is extensive and you can adjust a lot. In the comments, I can see that many people just don't see the possible settings. And yes, it is a long game. You don't play it in 8 hours. Perhaps you reach the 2. winter in this time.I personally really like our NPCs in the game. You can set them to worker, and they do all the things in the camp, or you set them to guardians, and they defend your camp. Or you set them to follower and take them with you exploring the map. I don't know anything about limits, I've seen player with over 30 NPCs in his ranks. From time to time, your camp will be attacked by enemys, raids. It is a cool feature.The music is, what's the right word? Not my taste. But also ok, perhaps more songs will come.The game needs ressources. And I don't mean copper, wood or stone. I mean GPU, RAM and CPU. I have a RTX 3090, my settings are on ""high"" (above there is ""ultra""). I have around 30-60 fps.

It takes way too long to craft things and to build the higher tier stuff. If they changed it to where it builds the higher tier things like the Toolmaker hut, to build it faster like the tier one stuff where you just click and it is done then that would be amazing, but to make you do a hammer animation that half the time doesn't work or your character resets the animation is both annoying and just pointless waste of time. 2. thing that needs to be improved is how your clan or village or settlement works. You should be able to pick jobs for your villagers not just let them roam and choose what they decide to work on. But you should be able to assign them to certain tasks. 3. The combat is sluggish and just not fun. Your character feels like it is super slow and heavy to the point where it just makes combat something you would rather not do. I wish the combat was a little more fast and easier to do than what it is. 4. Leveling skills is boring and takes way too long. I have been playing for hours and it just takes too long to level your attributes. That is the difference between being a fun game and being so time consuming that it becomes a chore to do. I really do like the game, but I dont have time to sit for hours at a time and not really have anything to show for the time I put into it.",Recommended,Early Access Review

I saw that they're doing some good maintenance and following feedback from the users so I decided to give it a go...This game? It's amazing. It's basically Mount and Blade mixed with Rimworld mixed with like... Valheim's food systems mixed with Manorlord. The game is very good for what it is so far and it was well worth the money I paid. The game is slow though and I can reliably describe it as playing Rimworld on the normal speed. While that sucks in terms of development, you're still a free agent who needs to complete quests, build reputation, build your village, and recruit new villagers. I haven't even scratched the surface yet and I am nearly a full 24 hours into this game and could easily spend several more real life days in here.It's not for everyone though as it's a slow burn and for those who don't mind a lot of running around. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Rimworld, Mount and Blade, or any settlement management type games.

If you choose to purchase an early access game you are agreeing to help in the development process.  If there is a bug report it ect.   Game stuff - The games combat is very similar to mount and blade which i really enjoyed.  Its simple but fun which to me is the entire point.  I am missing my horse though.   Devs- we need horses and lances and a charge mechanic stat.Village building is great.  I took the time to tear down and redesign my village layout several times which was a giant waste of resources, but hey it feels right ya known.The basic buildings take no time to craft while more advanced buildings are a bit painful unless you let your villagers do the  work.  Most things you can help out with or do yourself, but some tasks are just not worth your time.  Advanced building construction is one of them.The research tree is good and gives you goals, but it obviously will be fleshed out / adjusted before full release.   If i am not mistaken only villagers can use the research desks.   I say that because i couldn't figure it out of If the player is allowed.Right now you have to unlock a certain stage of the game before you can get villagers with a class attached to their names which they in turn unlock certain tech on the tree.    I would love to see a mechanic where i can develop these classes out of my early peasants.   If i am a player that doesn't care about saving villagers and just wants a tavern of my own i should be able to do that.The game has a bunch of different elements.   You can be a survivalist and go about hunting,  a village builder who plays like a town manager, a warrior who goes around hunting the bad guys, a savior who dedicates themselves to saving the helpless villages from the evil prince/king ect ect.   There is a huge amount of content and goals to strive for right now in early release.  Its not just a town builder, of which there are 1000 - just saying.Great game, loads of fun.

The AI need alot of work, the path finding, the workers you recruit the combat. to go into further detail starting with the pros. right out the gate you get the ability to start your little hut base any where you choose so long its not near a town, gathering materials and building a small starting area is simple, and the views are great, as well as it runs really well. Scrolling through the tech tree gets me excited to grind for all the goodies to come and be a knight in shining armor hacking and slashing through bandits. with that being said the combat in of its self is, different, its like for honor meets mordhau but a bit jank with hits not connecting if the target is on a slope below you, or just getting overwhelmed but enemies and dying really fast. having to cheese alot of fights by sitting on a rock they cant reach and raining arrows down on them is the only choice sometimes. which brings me to my next point. this just last session i attacked a wheat farm base thing. after fighting and killing all but 2 of the guards their weapons broke and they ran away, stopping me from claiming the base and looting the chest, and no matter what they wouldnt get close, staying at a set distance until i leave, respawning the whole base and having to fight all over again. my next point is the worker you recruit, often times they get stuck and cant move, or just idle even though they have tasks, but my biggest issue. is one that plagues me even now. And its that these workers have one thing on their minds, FOOD,, and will stop everything dropping what ever task is going on to eat, now why is that a problem? because on of the tech trees is a food cellar, which needs 2 mushroom stews and 2 meat stews, and every time we craft those and put them in the research station, they bee line it straight for it, not to research it, but to eat the stew being held inside, stopping our progress. its a fun game, but it needs some work, im excited to see what comes next and thats why i gave it a positive review, but its close. if there was a neutral option thats what this would get",Recommended,Early Access Review

Combat is awful in its present state - luckily, combat isn't really a thing in the beginning and you do not have to engage in combat. Instead, you'll need to base build, skill up, get some rep and work on your faction - and this is where the game turns around. After my first few hours I was ready to give up  - I'm glad I didn't. Once you understand the skill advancement and how that works, the game starts to come alive.  It's truly more sandbox (thus far) than RPG and once you get into the groove of how it works and what to do - the true joy comes out. It does have some issues: it's too slow, picking up mushrooms and herbs is traumatizing. Cutting trees is OK. And as you will soon find out - ""straps"" are completely broken.

Knowing more about exactly what behavior falls into each category is crucial for getting the behavior your looking for. An example of this for me is the delivery job. Are they delivering supplies to work benches  so that the crafters have the materials they need or are the crafters grabbing what they need themselves. I play A LOT of survival games but in a game like this with so many variables the player needs help to decipher what is happening.2The storage system needs overhauled a bit to make in not such a chore.

The combat mechanics chosen for this game significantly degrade what is actually a decent good surrounding it.

The gameplay is decent, thought there's balance considerations to bear in mind with resource gathering, and it can feel very grindy. leagues better than life is feudal. But, there is no excuse for just how poorly the game is optimized and such. No i don't have the best machine, but i can play many games within the past 2-4 years with medium or better settings. This game punishes you for going for low settings, and it almost all has to do with texture utilization. But it's fun, it's interesting, and it has a lot of charm anyway.

[ 狼 ] Aokami,42.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aokamisensei/,"May 14, 2024",0,"Here's an interesting game that's trying to be a lot of different things at once, but seemingly being mediocre at everything.Example-1. Tried to implement Mount & Blade combat, but it's way less fluid and way more janky.2. Village management and building but serious lack of Quality of Life. Some production buildings cant have limits/surplus set on them. NPC will jank and get stuck on structures because path finding is still very basic.3. RPG like party system or Mount and Blade companion system where you can get npcs to fight with you and be equipped and customized. Yet to manage their equipment you have to go up to each and every NPC.4. Janky enemy patrols that always causes them to start dashing towards somewhere.5. Building structures by clicking on them like 20~50+ times.TL:DR It's EA so it's understandable why it's unpolished. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at the current state.

I have played now for more than 10 hours and it feels like i have still the whole world to explore. I'm eager to see the late/mid-game mechanics.Generally I don't like games with a lot of farming (ex. ARK) but in this game it is quiet enjoyable, mainly because slowly your companions will do main farming (Wood, Food, Stone, etc) while you explore, fight, trade, build, complete quests and find rarer resources). It is still in early access but honestly, i only had one ""bug"" but the rest is polished af (just the dialogues feel a but strange).

Maevric,57.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198026731162/,"May 14, 2024",0,"For the price you're paying to get into this game, there is a lot to do here. Yes, there are things that could use more content, refinement, and fixes. That's to be expected in an Early Access game, and the Devs have very clearly said that they agree it has a long way to go. They have a good foundation to start with, so hopefully they stick with this project and continue to develop us an even more fantastic game.   It's essentially Mount and Blade. Directional based combat with feints, ripostes, fluid blocking, weapon speed/reach, and footwork/positioning. You can't run into combat just swinging and expect to do well every time, so mastering the mechanics can help make you a far better fighter. You will get outnumbered. You may have to kite. You can also bring a lot of friends. The army command system isn't as robust as others I've seen, but you can split groups to command to keep archers in the back, while your melee units hold a line or charge from a flank. Being able to command units on the fly can really save your bacon and make the fights much more favorable for you. You're the underdog here, so fight like you have to outthink them.   The AI could use some work on being more... aware? Have some guys with shorter weapons rush me, while the polearms try to flank and keep distance. Seeing a formations system for us and enemies would be awesome too. Doesn't even need to be super complex, just a few stances for some variation. Would be nice to see some other Bows, as well. Especially early on. More styles with different strengths!  This is a 3rd person Colony Sim game, it isn't meant to be played ""solo"". By that, I mean that you definitely want to rely on your NPCs to do most of your mundane work. Early on you'll need to gather things yourself since you won't have the numbers. Later on in the game you'll have higher stats and can help fill in gaps when things are needed or you're shifting priorities in your camp. Some skills we don't have, that NPCs do. Like construction Build Speed (Laborer Skill), for instance. Find out what your NPCs are good at, and make sure they have the stations and tools to do those jobs. Managing their priorities will make your life easier. Some time spent in the menus now, will help keep you in the action later when your bases can run autonomously. Make use of the ability to build ""Outposts"", which are essentially other settlements, and assign villagers accordingly. I haven't even fully flexed that system, but I can see the benefits of being able to make multiples places that produce different goods/resources, to be shipped to other Outposts. Yes, this game is a grind. It's not as bad as some make it sound though, once you learn how to run your settlement.  Some resources are more limited than you might think. Supposedly that is being worked on. In the mean time, be wise with your Logs and Metals. More ways to expand inventory space would be amazing as well. We get 3 options for the bag slot, and none have any ""improved"" versions. We need Backpacks. Make it fill up a Back/Cape slot and give it a visual. The building system also needs some help with the ""Building Needs Support"" warning being a bit too easy to trigger. Let me adjust elevation of the Blueprint or something.  The atmosphere is amazing, but could use some help. Please, make seasons longer and add more. I feel like my character has seen multiple years in the 30 in game days I've played. All of them consisting of Winter and Spring. I don't feel I ""achieved"" anything for living through my first winter in game. The sounds also have a lot going on, but no good sense of depth. I can hear a deer make a cry like it's 15 ft away, when really it's closer to 100-150ft. Directions aren't bad, but the depth/distance quality of the sound is lacking.  I'll review more later, but for now, this game is a steal at 30$. I aim for 1$ per hour for seeing if I get value out of the game. I'm over that and will definitely be getting more. There are still difficulty settings I haven't used! Give the Devs another try. For all the talk of them abandoning games, I can see why they dropped some of them. Larger PvP oriented games are a bit hard to balance, especially when they have crazy gimmicks. This project feels much more manageable, and is PvE as of now. Would be cool to see a larger map with more players and PvP, but I'm happy enough as is. Can't wait to see what comes next!",Recommended,Early Access Review

Brew_Gamer,153.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198264274543/,"May 14, 2024",0,"An absolutely astonishing game, especially for the price!  Bellwright checks nearly all the boxes of a spectacular game; a nearly cosmic blend of town management & survival craft genres. It is constantly updated (almost daily), has an extremely active & friendly discord community, and the DEVs are super responsive to concerns in this passion project.I'll start with the very short list of negatives (as of May 14th)....1.)  It is grossly missing the 3 D's of combat.  Duck, Dive, and Dodge.  Do not expect to quickly move away from an incoming melee swing, it's not going to happen.  There is no ducking, there is no diving out of the way.  You just have to hope you block at the right time or pray that your guy can swing faster.2.)  Placing down a blueprint and completing the building should automatically clear the underbrush and grasses underneath it.3.)  I am so very tired of hearing the phrase ""Have you spoken with the town elder yet?""  REALLY!?!!?  I am Bellwright level in your town, have done missions for all your neighbors, and built houses for you.The Positives!There are an absolute plethora of positives about this game; it's nearly impossible to list them all.1.)  Storage options are probably the best out of any game on the market with an unrealistic amount of customization.  No other game has this level of filter mechanics on storage..... and that says a lot from a man who's been gaming since the 80's, with well over 300 games in his library on Steam alone.2.)  The attention to detail on the map and how vast it is, is a testament to the level of passion these devs have for their crown jewel of a game.  From fishing shacks to farms, villages to outposts, the level of detail and care that went in to the layout of this map is nothing shy of extraordinary!3.)  The crafting recipes are perfect.  I can think of more than a dozen games that fail miserably when it comes to required resources to craft an item, especially based on time period or location.  Bellwright has put in the effort to make crafting seem more akin to realism versus needing random materials that would NEVER be used in crafting items.  For example.... One game in particular, where you have to Subsist in a Forest, requires you to add crystals and elmer's glue to upgrade your perfectly hand crafted glock, all while dodging bears & wolves having a tea party, giving ""high fives"" the chickens and rabbits.4.)  A masterfully crafted story line that actually ties the many villages together.  There are virtually no good games on the market, of this genre, that have such a rich and diverse story line right at the launch of the game.  Does it need a bit of work?  Maybe.  But I, for one, am very pleased with the current story line and missions that are available.  And what's more, is you do not have to follow a set path.  You are free to complete missions and story pieces at your own pace.5.)  NPC villagers that you get to hire and have working in your own village!  More games NEED this feature.  It's one thing to have robots craft everything for you, BUT the real test of an amazing developer is to incorporate humans with specific traits into a game to work along side the player.  And there is a need for specialized villagers with specific a mastery to be able to craft higher tier weapons, armor, foods, and buildings.  And even better, you have to work at getting them and be worthy of these top tier villagers.  You are not handed god-level people when you are a paltry nobody.....  you have to earn their respect and earn the right to intice them into your village.... no free rides for you.6.)  I could go on and on...... but I won't.  It is an amazing game, for an astonishing price!   I cannot praise it enough.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! Just buy it already.P.S. -   Expect to grind early on.... and expect having to build outposts.   If you don't like grinding or you want everything handed to you on a silver platter,  the Survival Craft Genre is not for you.  Instant gratification is not a mark of a truly great Survival game.  Ohh, I nearly forgot, if you are one of those who only chase high numbers or high FPS, do a little research on human vision and the way we perceive visually.  You can complain when the frame rate drops below 30.... beyond that, light levels & monitor refresh rates make the difference, not so much the frame rate.",Recommended,Early Access Review

I have about 100 hours in it and loved it until just recently. The game has a hard stop once you require raw hide to unlock the remainder of tier 2 items. You have to get the laborer to unlock the raw hide and he is only in the far villages. It's almost impossible to get your troops over there because they go through food so fast. And if you do what I did (which is the best option) you can still barley hang with the brigands with the gear you have up up until then and even if you do beat them you lose half your troops. I filled up my army of 25 people and maxed their inventory out with food, I walked em all the way to farnsworth, defeated the brigands, lost about 6 guys, personally went backnforth from my town to farnsworth to get the materials for the belltower. Then once it was built a party of 14 brigands came to farnsowrth!! Now with only 19 people with me who have the highest tier once gear possible, mixed with some metal hats and round shields, i got slaughtered. Absolutely ridiculous. Until they either add horses, make the food not go down as quick, allow fast travel troops, or  make it easier to get the raw hide to progress, I wouldn't recommend.

moderneraknight,76.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Artheisthegood/,"May 13, 2024",0,"Ok, so I don't normally do reviews but I feel I needed to put my two cents worth in on this game. I've read a lot of people complaining about the game. Mainly when it comes to combat. I agree the combat is awkward and slow, but you also have to understand this game is early access, that is what people seem to forget. Not only that but the fact that you go try to hold a shield while wearing armor and swinging a sword around and see how fast you can move. It's not going to be fast and fluid. Also in what reality do you honestly believe in the medieval times you could run at 5 dudes and be able to block them all and kill them all like it was nothing? You're not some godly knight, or feudal lord or something that has had extensive training in the art of combat. You have to keep an open mind when it comes to combat in the game. While it may seem slow at the start, as you level up skill your character does get better.I've seen people complain about the building aspect of the game as well, its not as bad as they make it out to be. Yes the villages may have buildings we don't have yet, and no there is no stone buildings or the ability to build a castle, but again this is early access. The devs may easily have it planned to have tier 4 and tier 5 of research technology that we can't see yet. It's like Enshrouded if anyone has played that game yet, they only released a portion of it for early access. So don't knock the game for that just because they didn't unlock or add everything at once, the game is generally a good game and as such should get good reviews not negative.On a side note to the building though, I will state that they cannot be interacted with as far as customization goes. They are cookie cutter buildings that you can't do anything with. You can't place furniture in them, you can't paint them, you can't hang banners, or mount trophies on the wall, which to me is a major bummer. I doubt there is future changes to make this happen, but I can hope at least. I'd like to be able to sit in my tavern with my buddies after a bandit raid and lift a tall pint of ale in victory. SKAL!!!Now onto the AI that some people seem to have an issue with. I'm only 25 hours in on day 46 for my first play-through, and I'm on tier 2 buildings. I've only hired 2 people, the first one being the hunter the elder of the village wanted me to get. I've had no issues maintaining adequate resources with just 2 individuals and they don't mess up or burn through my resources. I have not fiddled with the changing priority and left everything at 5. I actively use the logging camp and Que up logs and sticks, I use the foraging hut to gather mushrooms and berries. And not once have I had an issue with the AI, no issue feeding them, they do all my farming after I stole wheat from the mill field, and it is really nice. I can explore and come back and my building blueprints I put down are assembled. So i fail to see how people are having issues. Maybe having to many AI to start before really getting built up is what hurts some? I'm honestly not sure.Stats are a bit of a pain as some have said, but understandable too. Now I will agree that not getting the strength stat by doing mining, chopping, or things of that nature is a bit off. Even just 1 exp per harvest or something to strength would be nice. Otherwise you have to gain it reading books or through combat. And combat melee is not easy but rewarding when you beat down 5 bandits. I generally start with a bow to lower their numbers then I'll go in swinging and finish them. You don't get exp for strength on animals by the way. I do like that if I start something like cooking and the AI finishes it, you still get the exp which is really nice. I hope to see more stats in the future like blacksmithing or forging.Armor seems to be a waste besides looks to me so far. I have the best you can make in the bottom tier and I still get hit for the same damage it seems. Maybe once I get to tier 3 metal armor I might be better off. The winter cloak also doesn't seem to keep me warm in winter because I still get a debuff for being cold. So that might be a glitch. Overall the armor looks good though as you upgrade.This game was designed to be slow so you don't rush to the endgame, I like the pace. Its keeping me entertained and making me feel like I've really accomplished something when I get that next new building, tool, or gear unlocked. It's not for everyone I can understand, but slow and steady wins the race. Don't be in a rush, just enjoy what you paid $30 for.",Recommended,Early Access Review

As for the game itself I have been waiting for something just like this for ages. Chill gameplay mixed with frenetic rushes, open world to the point where undirected players may loose steam without setting their own goals. The game is structured around a story but is loose in what objectives and what path you take to make it your own. Decent tech tree, crazy in depth building construction to the point where you have to place each log board and thatching only downside is the buildings are all prefabs. combat is a touch rough but simple to learn hard to become epic enough to solo many enemies at once.

The crafting system is well designed and thought out, the armor throughout the tiers are functional, meaning don't expect your cutting damage weapon to do too much damage to a chainmail clad bandit. On that topic- reclamation parties and higher tier bandits. The combat can take some getting use to, but is do-able. I am hoping for a rebalance of combat strengths in the future. Once you take a town, which can be hard despite having 13 villagers of varying attributes and shields still get decimated by 5 town-tier brigands. Leaving me with my bow and 90 arrows running and sniping headshots as they run after me then retreat. Again, hoping for a rebalance there, Building can be tedious, but using villagers in your town speeds it up nicely. On the topic of villagers- managing them can be tedious as well, but if done well can make everything run smoothly so you can run around the map completing quests and gaining loot. Most of the quests are fetch quests, but some have word play-checks to make sure you're paying attention and not just being a delivery boy who gets a tip.

drummerkeenan,81.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198097387623/,"May 10, 2024",0,"I really like this game. Some of the very good positives to take away are: -good challenge, risk to reward ratio-you can be pretty creative in town design-a good tech tree pathway-interesting experience points building, i like the books-it's easy to put down and come back to the game later. -pretty casual game but can get intense. Example, you're out minding your business picking shrooms and hunting rabbits and you get a raid notice. So far it seems you get 1 day to prepare for the raid and if you are like me you might not have planned out your town very well, or have good weapons for defense or offense. Who knows. But it can be nail biting when the next day comes hoping you've prepared well enough to fend the raiders off. -the idea behind the game, i like the story. -this game so far gets a lot right for me. it would seem that as you gain experience using the tools and weapons you will slowly get better and faster at using them. I really like that. Getting fast rewards is annoying. Cons:-I'd like to see better animations when chopping wood. See the damage my axe is doing to the tree. Really that is missing in just about all of the harvesting and gathering functions, that would also serve as a visual progress bar.-distance feels off at times when doing tasks. It's kinda hard to explain. -even when food is available, i see my population showing they are hungry sometimes. This usually makes me want to force feed them which takes time away from other things i am doing. -when you are about to be raided, it would be nice if the defending party would feed themselves some of the higher hp items if available such as meats. If they switch roles from a worker to a guard or companion, their meals should be different, allowing them to accomodate the new task.-graphics and animations, they are not bad, they just aren't amazing either. when this comes out of early access as a full game I would love to see more realism. This is lower in my list of cons as it really isn't that bad, the gameplay really makes up for it. -snappier inventory and dialog boxes. there seems to be some latency when i open and move items around-the ai genrerated voices. some are pretty good. most are pretty bad. if you are using ai it would be more fun to have the abilty to type back and have them generate original dialog.

Minki San,120.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/minkisan/,"May 10, 2024",0,"So I have to edit this review. I was sort of happy with Bellwright, I felt like it would get a balance so was OK to recommend it, then I found Nexus mods so could take the grind out of the game as well as deal with the clunky combat by increasing the damage I output. After modding fights became a one/two hit win. It meant I had to stay skilful but could defeat a group of enemies if I was able to use my shield and sword effectively. None of the changes I made to my game mattered because I was playing it how I wanted solo. It did not affect anyone but me. Then the last update dropped and Mods no longer work making Bellwright the clunky early access mess it was. The reason I have now thumbed down my review is that the mods are not working. How easy would it be to have a conversation with the modding community to find out what can be done to help them, what ideas they had and perhaps even look at the most popular mods to understand what people don't like about the game. Many people will play the game as is, many people are way better at games than me and will find the game too easy in its current state, many people will love the grind. I don't and until Mods are properly supported this game is staying thumbs down. I am going to keep playing Bellwright and my thumb up comes with a caveat. The game is early access and at the moment this is a good game, but if it doesn't change then I will change this to a negative. The game is a grind. Combat is clunky and every one on one fight is too easy but these fights are so few and far between that they don't matter. 9 times out of 10 you will be facing at least 4 opponents and you will not be able to strike without being hit. Then you will not be able to run because you will get hit which causes an animation to play which stops you moving. This means you get hit and you essentially are trapped and will die. If you evade and use a bow then you will be chased down and struck very quickly, hit head shots and you will do a little damage and then get hit and trapped while trying to switch weapons. If you climb onto something you will often get stuck so you cannot move away from arrows. That said, you can liberate an entire village alone with a bow if you do not get stuck and have patience. It's a good job because your army is next to useless. Call them all together and head to a battle, by the time you arrive, most of them will have left to look for food. Call them all together, dress them, feed them and arm them, by the time you're done they will be annoyed or hungry again. Far too much micromanagement. Upgrade a weapon and you have to manually hand the weapons out. Call the reservists to arms and they will turn up with whatever they were using, carpenters hammers are not as sharp as swords. If it wasn't for mods I probably would have stopped playing but there is a potentially great game. There needs to be a far better way to manager your villagers, there needs to be a way for your villagers to fast travel. Be warned, this game is a grind, everything takes a lot of time and the constant traipsing around picking up after your villagers and babying them is my biggest issue however, I do still recommend this game at the moment. If, in a few months, some of these serious issues are being addressed then my review will stay positive. If you can put up with the issues for now definitely worth buying. If you are more cautious then wait, check in six months and see how things look.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

caninmyham,86.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/imtehathoritah/,"May 10, 2024",0,"TL;DR: Would recommend. Rimworld-esque colonist management, Mount and Blade like combat, large open world with quests and co-op. Unpolished, but still fun even as-is. 8/10     Personally, I find it refreshing to play a crafting-based management game where in you can construct say, a metal axe, with a single resource unit of metal as opposed too a massive quantity (A la rust or rimworld, for example). You collect resources in lower quantities, but each individual resource is able to go further as a result; once you get even two or three NPCs collecting resources on your part, you'll be able to almost entirely automate a self-sufficient resource-collecting outpost producing low-tier foodstuffs and one or two basic materials.     At the time of this review, I've played 25 hours and progressed half way through the second tier of the current three ""Tiers"" of technology available. Your mileage would likely vary; I meandered a bit for side quests, but primarily focused on progressing my village as quickly as possible to test out the villager management systems. The map is MASSIVE; if you took the time to explore about (likely running away from bandits for a majority of it), you could likely easily spend the same time just getting the entirety of it mapped out, visiting each currently existent village. At the same time, if you steamed through with no regard to quests while prioritizing your village above all else, you could probably cover the same ground in 10 or 15 hours of play.     In the games present state, I would argue that it is already worthy of it's price; it encapsulates mechanics from at least three different genre of games. That being said - I can only hope that it's development continues, as this is truly (as plenty of others have said) a polished gem; though one which could certainly use a lot of refinement.",Recommended,Early Access Review
Nodd,4.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198287206827/,"May 10, 2024",0,"So what do we think of Bellwright?I only have four hours into this so its still a bit early for a review but here's my first impressions...The game looks really good. The graphics are super crisp, good textures & loads of detail. The character animations however are super derp. Everything feels like its in slow motion, the jump animation is fringing hilarious, like you're on the moon. I do like how the character sometimes chooses to climb over a fence rather than jump over it however.Combat is kinda interesting, based on directional movement of the mouse. Attacks & blocks can come from different directions. Having only killed a few wolves at this point, & my companion NPC did most of the tanking, I can't say I did much more than just spam the attack button. I expect, once you get used to the directional stuff, combat is probably pretty cool.Crafting & building. I knew this was a thing when I got the game but I didn't realize just how much you need to rely on NPCs to do stuff for you. This game is mostly about running around & interacting with various NPC menus & screens. At this point I'm hopelessly inept at this rather important part of the game. I'm finding it quite frustrating. As much as I hate them, the game needs tutorials.Questing... As with many games, its often frustrating when the quest steps aren't clearly outlined. A couple of times now I found myself stuck, not knowing what the game wants me to do to progress the quest. On a similar note, I ended up having to reset my first game as I built the research desk at the wrong location. That quest's instructions were somewhat misleading.Anyway, overall I think this game has potential. However it clearly states in a popup message every time you launch the game that its in early access. And I have to agree, it is very much in an early state of development. I'm probably going to let this game sit for a while, maybe revisit it again in the future.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

I quit playing last week mid-play just due to bothersome tedium that was becoming the game. It was fun and I still enjoy it but it takes insanely too long to do anything and as the raiders get more in number it becomes downright annoying to fight them. They group up and unless your group out groups them... you lose. There is no skill or strategy to fighting. Certain resources, like the GD straps, are super annoying and needed in high number. Many things just don't work quite right and you'll find 30 minutes of time have been wasted trying to farm resources that your people should be farming for you.overall it was still fun because it was honestly a new type of game. However, it feels hollow and no way will I commit another 30-40 hours to ""finish it"" because it does not feel rewarding. I love it but...The game is lots of fun, it feels like you are progressing and moving along. I enjoy the system in place for hiring villagers, crafting etc.I do not enjoy the lack of instructions. Many times I find myself searching online for basic functions. I do not enjoy the incredibly hard enemies that pop up early on. The just smash my army and me really fast. Villager jobs and priorities can get really messy. Overall I love it. It is fun but does have several quest bugs and other issues.

Use it like a **** polehammer. (no crossbow/longbow either)-Combat formation is non existent, expect mosh pits. -Bow projectile is slow as ****, ballistics are not accurate.-Armor rating but no discerning information on what cut,pierce,blunt effects are. (Pitchfork a pierce but you cant thrust...)-Random clipping of hits, hit boxes and hit range is janky, some moments you or they can kill someone even when their weapon doesnt reach them. -Bow is the only dominating weapons for player due to cheesing, if you try to fight properly, you will get killed fast by brigands. (Reasons? Liberate a town to get the people you need)-Animations are janky, will not climb when needed to, will bounce around, you cant aim upward or downward, you can not vault so if you are a hit n run person, expect your booty to be slapped. -No mounts...... (Walking sim)------------Building------------------Most building have no indoor experience, only out door aesthetic.-GOD AWFUL amount of CLICKING, why not make it a progression automatically instead of a pressing tournament. -No proper defense building or defense weaponry. (Besides a fence and a guard post, not even a stone fence)-No landscaping, so make sure you find a flat area.-No proper indicator on *usable spot* so if you back that sucker on a cliff and the dot is pretty much facing the cliff, well then you just got screwed. -Terrible refund rate of buildings.-Do not build compact, ai bugs out.-No transport carts.----------AI------------Either brain dead, or defying orders, you have peasants who does not do what they are task and just sits around, until you refresh them.-People you hire does not have fast travel so, (they take ages to get from their village to yours, and they get stuck as well, you cannot fast travel your party so you must venture out like companions over great distance.)-AI inventory is pathetic, they drop their equipment anywhere, and sometimes leaves it on the floor. -UI for AI management could have been better. Trying to find the person (who dropped his/her equipment) to reequip him is tedious. -Your AI will venture out like nomads when in winter and no food, you cannot collect food in winter. -AI profession is a terrible concept, why not make all AI recruits able to be trained to the profession you choose instead of giving stat base generics and rares. (People will complain about game speed, but you can easily lengthen that process the same without the need to have these preset characters some with terrible stats)-AI are slow and walk like fashion models. -AI bandit patrol are clunky, when engage, you will have occasional moments where enemies will flee from you, (they are not actually fleeing, the script of ""Patrol"" continues to move even when the entity is engage, so when at certain distance, they will reset to their patrol marker.) Making the chase even more painful for you. ----------------Environment------------You cannot swim, you will be teleported.-Hitting objects such as mining and cutting are janky. -Props and their hit boxes, janky.-You a cheezy player? Find a house or a rock to climb up on.- A better Cheezy player? Find a terrain slightly lower to the enemies and they have twice the amount of hardship hitting you since they cant aim down. -AI will hurt themselves due to buildings, they will fly up in the air and take damage, also you as well.-Limited Logs, and even minerals. ----------------food----------------Food rots, and rots fast compare to real world. -Food base health and stamina, (exactly like outwards) is not a good formula for a game trying to be like mount&blade.-Rations do not stack, and your companions will need them rations when your going places.Overall, i cannot recommend this game.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

I play alone for about 8 hours a day, and I play with a friend for about 3 hours  day. (Yes I am retired with no life outside) When playing with my friend, we got antlers right away, we are on about day 40. Playing alone, I still have not gotten any antlers, I have been trying to complete the three trophy quest and not being able to complete this quest has severly hampered my game progress. i am on day 72 in solo, and still not a Protector yet. i am even building my next level village, yet cannot progress the first town quest line. I have killed TONS of deer, and have looted 20-30 boar tusk and wolf teeth, but not a single antler. I can get the rare loot idea, fine, but if part of a main quest there must be either a way around it (someone in the next city selling one for a very high price for example) or a game mechanic that clicks in (ok 25 deer kills zero antlers make one drop on 26) The furstration is startng to make me want to do something else. I really like the game otherwise, but for now it feels like ONLY a deer hunting game, not having fun only hunting deer and feel boxed in. Perhaps this quest can be comletely ignored yet I am doing something else wrong not to progress the city quests, not sure, not obvious, not a hint, nothing to tell me anything other than give me three trophies, punk",Recommended,Early Access Review

Its_Lexi_R,85.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Memesiss/,"May 8, 2024",0,Best way to describe this...Life is Feudal had babies with Valheim....At first it started out very bland but as you progress it gets more and more in depth and enjoyable. The raids can sometimes just be to much which is difficult because you need to unlock the towns to actually get armor upgrades but you cant defend the towns easily. So you need to learn to pick and choose your battles. I was worried it would be another LiF grind fest where you spent 8hrs of REAL WORLD to make sure the place was flat to place your shack.... It does have some performance issues but overall for a EARLY ACCESS its better then 90% of the crap that has been coming out. I think devs are doing the right thing and not telling us the future plans and just fixing things as they come out. I do want to see AI fixes they tend to get scared or hungry to much to actually do anything and if they get scared by a wolf they dont return they just stand still,Recommended,Early Access Review

Hardstyles,138.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017433434/,"May 7, 2024",1,"The game in its current state will offer you a ton of things to do. I really enjoy the fact that you can play this game in multiple ways. The pacing of the game and it's interactions are quite enjoyable. You really do feel like your slowly building a kingdom. Progress is slow but worthwhile. The only setback I have right now is move speed. I would really enjoy a few items to be added. Such as a horse, and some sort of transport cart that can be researched. Perhaps for trading between settlements.One thing people need to understand is that the pace of the game is actually very integral to the way you play. A ""year"" is like 7 days or something. So to those complaining that your food is not lasting very long. Keep in mind it technically lasted a few months in game time. There is also a way to expand the shelf life of food with Tier 2 and I believe T3 buildings. All foods are different. And the more simplified they are, the faster they go bad. If you plan on using the army functions. You need to plan ahead. Shields can break, arrows will run out, and your followers will get hungry during battle and just leave you to find food. So like a good leader, you should make sure your army is well stocked for the expedition. Use the fast travel signs!  -  It makes a huge difference in the pace of the game. You will still be doing a lot of running, but you can cut those distances a ton by placing the fast travel signs along any resource hot spot you need. I specifically keep mine near towns, hunting zones, mining zones, and lakes for the reeds. What would otherwise be a ten minute run, is now a 1 min there and back gathering session. The downside is your followers can not fast travel with you.The progression is very slow. But also keep in mind you're a dude starting from nothing to building an empire. If you ever find yourself thinking the game is too tedious. Remember you are able to automate your building/gathering with your villagers. You can get to a point where the game does most of the tedious tasks for you, while you get to go explore and hunt or kill bandits and do quests without worry. Almost every one of your buildings can be automated by your villagers. Give them orders and they will do it all for you. At times I have even just afk'd to let them work on construction projects. It doesn't seem to hurt much. Though bandits can raid you occasionally. Overall it's a great game as is. But definitely has areas for huge improvement. Features i'd like to see:1. Viewing my populations inventory without running up to them. Micromanaging my blob of companions is brutal when they are constantly running around and moving places. 2. Animal husbandry/horses. I am not sure if it's planned but horses would be amazing. And having a functional farm would just add to the level of depth the game has. 3. Non-ai voices. They aren't really an issue and eventually just sound normalized. But I really enjoy the unique characters and would love to see them have more life to them with real voices and emotions. It would really add a lot to the game. Some of the characters are downright mean and sassy, while others are scared etc. But they all sound like A-hole robots. So it hurts the immersion for sure. I will add however. I really enjoy the amount of random dialogue you get when walking near people. The town feels alive in that instance. 4. Castle walls, and towers that can connect and become functional. I think the end game would be amazing to be able to erect a real castle over time and have my village around it. It would be the ultimate rags to riches story. The guard tower is already a glimpse into that possibility. The castle doesn't entirely need to have inter workings, but tall stone towers and walls that can be stood on would be really neat. Especially when being raided in late game. 5. Stone walls. In general I'd like to be able to make stone walls that aren't so shabby. 6. Alter the ground to make paths. The village is nice but without paths it doesn't seem as immersive. I'd like to be able to change the ground in certain areas to have a pathway texture. So I can make my area more lively and realistic.I'm sure i'll find more. But for now this is all I have.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Syliss,56.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973117570/,"May 7, 2024",0,"Very enjoyable game so far. I was expecting something with a bit of an RTS gameplay mixed in but it's closer to a Kingdom Come Deliverance with companions. The world looks good and voice acting is ...meh...In terms of survival, food isn't necessary to live but does provide important health and stamina buffs and stamina is important in this game. Respawn but no permanent death. Building, crafting and harvesting are ok with building being the most enjoyable in my opinion. Watching your 1 hut expand into a small village is satisfying. These task are made easier by assigning npc members you've recruited from other villages. Hunting isn't horrible but definitely needs a little work. It seems that there's going to be a story developed around revenge eventually. I can get with that. The seasons do change and bandit attacks seem to be annual so far.All in all, if the development of the game was to stop today, there would definitely be a lot of missed potential left on the shelf but I wouldn't feel like I've wasted my money.

naomha,9.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/naomha/,"May 6, 2024",0,"Pretty fun game. Combat is pretty much on par with Kingdom Come. It's a survival/action-adventure/city building/crafting game and it seems t be going in a great direction. However, I will say this. Expect a SLOW grind in the beginning of the game. You can't really get any followers until you up your rating and you can't up your rating unless you do a bunch of fetch quests. Just letting you know now. However, in between all of this, you'll be researching new mats, building new buildings, exploring the map, hopefully NOT dying to Bandits (they suck) and making items to upgrade your character and improve their stats. Graphics are pretty great. Sound is good and done well. Combat is hit or miss. It depends on if you liked Kingdom Come. If you didn't play it then it's a directional based swing and block. If you pay attention you'll be fine but a LOT of people hate the combat because of this. You can actually turn off fluid blocking in the settings which helps ALOT. Still, you do have to get used to it. All in all, a pretty great early access game. Hopefully the developers finish it. Their publisher, Snail, does NOT have a great track record whatsoever with allowing the developers to actually finish a game (see Last Oasis, Dark & Light, etc).

You/villagers being able to sit, eat, drink, crouch is needed. Right now the movement is restrictive and outdated. Lots of buildings need interaction badly, can't use anything except chests and beds in the dwellings, nothing is animated. When it snows, the snow shows up layered on the floor of interior roofed areas, this can be easily fixed a few ways, particle culling, material properties, scripting.Small gripe, but placed lighting is static. I've been building a tavern environment in UE 5.3, my lights flicker, cast dynamic shadows and behave generally as real open flames would (with zero impact to performance) and as a result the tavern feels alive. Give me a couple hours and I could do the same for Bellwright, super easy to do with light functions and a little clever scripting. **Modkit is in the works** If the devs see this review, I am a solo dev in unreal 5, I love rigging, animating, lighting.

I have fun to try and see new concepts or combinations of existing concept. And there are quite some in this game and with it so much potential (at least in my opinion)!Basically Bellwright combines elements of Mount and Blade (Fighting), Palworld / Rimworld (Eco), 7 Days 2 Die (more or less weekly bandit raids - not as crouded as in 7D2D, but fun in combination with counter raids and liberating the villages) and several quests/quest lines to progress in the story and the game world; also reminds me a little bit of Enshrouded.The tech tree is structured reasonably and quite extensive for an Early Access Game - I love the variety of weapons and armour.I must admit I didn't really follow the dialogs / story ... I'm more the progress grinder type ... so no comment on that topic.I read some moaning about the food and stamina system. But for me it's quite balanced after the usual torture in the early beginnings of a survival game and when you realise that there is a food buff system (my stamina bar fills half my screen most of the time - don't see any issues).Also the ore mining is less worse than it seems - just use your pplz to do the job... once a basic eco is running everything is quite chill and you can focus on the fun stuff.Until now I had no perfomance issues or crashes, but other people do. So, maybe check out info on their topics / HW setup before buying.The topic concerning the developer and publisher ... huh, what should I say :D ... as an ARK player with several k hours I have my experience with Snail Games ... more snakes than snails ... but they never kept me from having fun in ARK. I can't say anything about the developer. I never played LO - but as far as I read, the toxic PvP community was more to blame for the failure of LO than the developer.Despite Bellright already is lots of fun and worth several dozens of hours playtime in my case, in my imagination (no confirmed features - just my thoughts) the future may be even more promising: additional branches in the tech tree like stone stuctures / castles and mounts / cavalry, maybe lifestock farming, additional weapons and armour - not sure if I'd like to see siege equipment and stuff - that may be too much :); completion of current map (at least there are unpopulated/unexplorable areas that seem to be filled in the future) + maybe map extensions; more story focus and content (maybe I just missed it :D); ...For me Bellwright is totally worth its price, even at this early stage.",Recommended,Early Access Review

PeacefulMountain,137.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034505620/,"May 6, 2024",1,"The game is pretty addictive. It's a mix between Medieval dynasty and Bannerlods but mostly MD. I only have 77 hours of playtime and didn't do any major event of the game. Just recruiting and building villages and army but I think I had enough time to be able to judge the game as it is right now. First your character. I didn't see a lot of customation options. Barely any but I don't really care for that and it might change in the future so nothing to add too much on. The game have some RPG element where your character have stats (one handed, two handed, bow, shield, cooking, gathering etc...) The way you level up your skill is by reading. I'm not sure doing the action count, so far I only managed to level up by reading ability books but I might be wrong. Food system work like valheim. Not eating will no kill you but if you want to have better health or stamina or regen you need to eat. The better the food, the better the increase in stats. Managin food can be annoying as each food has a time consumption that can be relatively low in my opinion. I wouldn't mind an increase in spoiling time tho, as I think it's still often too short.There's a raid system similar to the purge from Conan exiles. You can get raid on your main settlement or any additionnal outpost you create; The raid level will be adjusted to the targeted settlement. The difficulty increase each time you defeat and decrease each time you loose and you need to manage every settlement's raid threat independently. This can really time consuming the more outpost you create. I lowered my raid frequency just to have better time to prepare.Combat : The combat is pretty similar to mount and blade where it's directionnal input. It's not bad, but don't expect too much dept and to go throught people like butter. There's a huge gap between what you can equip yourself with and your villagers vs the armored bandits that will need to take down because of raids or village liberation. So as of now is either endless grinding to outnumber the ennemy or cheese the AI. Each villager can be assign to 3 job : Companion, Worker, Garde. As a companion, the villager in your village will act as soldier in your army and will respond to command like : charge, go here, and engage ennemy by themseelf in proximity. This is really cool but require bigger management the bigger your village growth. You have to make sure that every villager in your army is well equipped individually (Armor, weapons). You have to make sure they are fed and have food to last as long as your project requires. So for an expedition in a bandit camp or defend against raid, you have to prepare the food needed, equippement needed, craft everything (or create a production chain to craft by the villagers), gather everyone and either equipp them yourself, or point them to a container with all the gear so they can just equip themselves. And for that it would be great to have a screen to check the villagers equippement. I understand it's not realistic to be able to swap gears out of range, but at least let us check for when we need to craft more. The game is pretty difficult, as I said, bandits will be most of the time be better equipped than what you can craft so it takes time to adjust but I really do like the game. The AI voice can be a bit annoying but it should be replaced during developpement so I'm not too worry.I'll recommend for everyone that like Medieval Dynasty or city builders. But be prepare to grind and don't expect a too much out of the combat.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Issue I have noticed as of recent was my cook leaving things to burn even before night time. I have one person set to cook. They put mushrooms on the smoker and campfire but just leaves them to burn. Didnt have the problem last week. I have three workers at the moment and I made sure they were not overwhelmed between them. One person focuses on cooking, other farming, and another who does research and crafting. Gathering set to 3 everything else set to five, yet the food gets burned. I dont have extra tasks looping that would be taking up ,any who cooks, time. She literally will put mushrooms down and just stand by the fire, then walk off at some point and never removes them to put back into food storage and there is room. I have two food storages to keep up. Even set the campfire and smoker to lvl 1, everything else set to priority 5 and it didnt change anything.New Problem (5/15/2024)Construction on a building stopped. Workers were working on it, we all went the sleep then just wouldnt work on it again. Never had an issue building any of my other buildings.Carpenter mallets are 100% repaired, they have plenty of food. I set the barn to priority #1. Set their priority for construction to #1, everything else is set to ""no"" (circle with line across it). When they had stopped working their Carpenter hammers were just at half health. After I repaired them I put them in storage. Then tried putting them into their inventory, and even on their bar. They just walk around the village in idle mode. I set them to companion/guard to reset them to villager in hopes it would help. It did not fix it. I closed game and reopened it and it changed nothing. I even validated the game in steam library and it changed nothing.Guessing only option is to delete it and place a new one down, but the annoyance on gathering some of the materials doesnt have me too happy over the situation.Tried to report it to the bellwright website which is listed for their bug reports under the discussion page, and for some reason their report page doesnt accept my email.

First, I am having a great time! There are a few things that would improve my experince.1) Improve trapper AI for them to pick up more than 1 trap at a time, spending toomuch time walking with empty bags.2) REDUCE FOOD SPOILAGE rate! OMG before I can't even get to my campaign destination before my follwers are out of food and it spoils in my bag faster than I can keep them fed! Once building tier 2 building reduce the number of clicks. The animation is cool and all but I don't want to sit there an click to hammer all these nails, with the amount of time it takes I could build a real bird house or something. Seriously, myself and 2 follwers took 10 mins to build the tool building. TOO long.3) Fix the storage system so that it actually stops making items once it hits the max target, I can't stop my cook from cooking EVERY mushroom.4) Fix outpost deliveries. I saw online some people said it was worthless to do and some said you have to know how to do it corresting. I followed someone elses post and it doesn't work for me.5) Get follwers to stop putting their weapons away. If I give them a weapon, I want them to keep it and repair their tools or weapons if the resources are available (maybe we  can set that like, if there are more than 15 of this resouce availble repair it will repair) Or away that they put their weapons in their personal chests outside their huts and grab them when i call them for duty. That would be great.6) A way to set what foods the followers eat.7) Have my body/grave stay in the world a little longer, sometimes it takes awhile to get back :(I will update as I remeber my other ideas.",Recommended,Early Access Review

On top of that, headshot detection is a joke, arrows directly to the forehead register as body shots half the time.

Ice,27.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197978263328/,"May 5, 2024",0,"It's okay, but there are some issues with some of the mechanics mainly with the settlement management system.Bellwright needs to consolidate it's settlement resource requirements into one page. Each settlement could have a page of ""resources"" that are gather-able based on the current buildings that have been constructed. This page could allow the player to set the resource gathering requirements, and craft ""one-off""/""top-off"" amounts. This makes it easier for the player to see what requirements the NPCs are focusing on.More messages are needed to explain some of the NPC issues being experienced. For instance, if an NPC is not gathering a resource that is set, why? If research is set to priority 1 and has the resources and people assigned, why aren't they working on it?NPCs sometimes drop weapons and materials off in storage when that storage is set to not accept those items/materials. So when the settlement is attacked, the NPCs don't have weapons/what they need.Currently there are some issues with cooking, for example, there aren't any menus for the smoker. This is an issue if you want to make a smoker and a campfire with a cauldron, as the NPCs will automatically smoke things like mushrooms. There should be a whitelist option for cooking.Managing an army is exhausting. NPCs will actually leave your group if they get hungry...This is painful early on as food not only expires in the inventory quickly, but gets digested extremely fast as well. On top of this, there is no menu to help feed all of your army or at least a single location for the army to ""eat from"". I've tried selecting the army and commanding them to ""eat"" from storage, but most of the time all of the NPCs just gather up and prevent each other from accessing it. This means you have to go to each NPC and give them food constantly.NPCs should just teleport to you while they are in an army if they get too far away. This get's rid of the fast travel issue and the straggler effect seen when having an army.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

There's a worry that the developers might abandon this game, but I really hope not because it has serious potential.The graphics and sound are top-notch, creating an immersive medieval vibe. There's real pressure to keep your village thriving so your villagers don't bail on you. My main wish is for the developers to fix the core issues before adding more stuff. Otherwise, it might feel like they're ignoring the players who are already here.Here's what I loved and loathed in my time playing:Loved:•Graphics and sound are fantastic.•The tech tree is huge, offering loads of building and crafting options.•Villagers feel like real characters, even if some of them are a bit whiny.•The slow pace of progression feels rewarding.Loathed and Suggestions:•Side notifications need to specify which community they're about.•The delivery screen needs to be clearer.•There's confusion about what ""completed"" means in delivery notifications.•It'd be helpful to see villagers' moods on the population overview.•Loot timers need to be longer so we don't lose stuff we've walked miles for.•The companion overview needs names to make it easier to manage.•Followers' food and weapon choices can be frustratingly nonsensical.•Mission timing needs clarification.•Notifications disappear too quickly.•We need seasonal info in the UI.•Custom waypoints on the map and fast travel or mounts would be great.•Showing building workable radius on the map and minimap would help planning.Overall, it's a promising game, but it needs some fixes and tweaks to reach its full potential.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Also, the satisfaction of construction is unparalleled. Witnessing villagers collaborate to construct a building, a task that would take a solo player 25 minutes, is immensely gratifying. Progression may be gradual, but it's quick enough to maintain interest across multiple projects. The expansive tech tree consistently provides new goals to strive for. However, the highlight for me has undoubtedly been leading raids with my villagers. Equipping them for battle and unleashing them upon stronger foes is a thrill like no other, particularly when they wreaked havoc on bandits controlling the only wheat farm on the map.

scabbycakes,63.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/scabbycakes/,"May 4, 2024",0,"So far the game is really good - it has a lot in common with Medieval Dynasty, but a lot more to do.  As of this date though it's crashy and really needs some tweaking though.  Since it's an EA game it gets a pass since things will surely improve over time.Here's the biggest issue I have after playing the game for some time now.  If you want to erect some higher tier buildings, you'll need gain access to higher level villagers by liberating towns which is I guess the focus of the game, but it's not a fun endeavour.  I'd like to be able to hire apprentices with a high enough rating without raising an army - maybe have a peaceful mode or diplomatic options and not do any combat unless you want to.  A suggestion is to have personal quests for apprentices /experts to unlock the ability to hire them instead of requiring a town's liberation.     Next it's unclear as to what actions are affected by what skills.  For example there's a ""harvesting"" skill and a ""farming"" skill, if I'm harvesting the stuff I've grown on a farm I'm not sure what skill I want to improve. Another example is building speed, I'm not sure what skill improves that. Since buying books to improves these skills isn't cheap, it'd be nice if these were clarified.  Same goes for weapons skills, is 2H weapons skill applicable to a battleaxe?  There doesn't seem to be much indication until you actually research the weapon, find the resources to make it, and then swing it and hope your investments were right.  After the first tier, buildings take a long time for you to build since you basically have to hammer in every board.  I like this!  But if you find out it's in a bad spot there's no way to move the building or rotate it and you have to tear it down and start over.  I get it, this means you have to be deliberate and careful when choosing where to build something, but it's kind of punishing.  It'd be cool if you could move it just once within a radius for free, after that you have to live with your choices.Animals aren't slowed by injuries - if you don't one-shot kill them then they turn into formula 1 cars and disappear.  The opposite should be true, if you wound them they should slow down.  Same goes for bandits, they should slow down the more you wound them.  The fast travel system is great, I like it!  You use a currency called Renown and some meagre resources and can plunk a fast travel location on a road.    Resource distribution needs some improvement, some resources are only found in one location (peat, for example) and it'd be nice to be able to get at least a little bit from elsewhere on the map.   Iron ore is a higher tier resource but impossible to get without a higher tier pickaxe, but it'd be great to be able to pick a little bit up here and there while scouring the map for a lucky little surprise just like copper and tin.Equipping your villagers is a chore.  Your villagers are mostly autonomous with everything else but there's no way to assign them weapons and armour to wear without chasing them down and manually putting items in their slots.  I'd love the ability for them to have a weapons and armour priority auto-equip toggle.Also, I'd like a corpse retrieval option, losing a backpack over and over by the same pack of invincible wolves parked on your corpse is just infuriating, especially when that corpse has no ""take all"" button and you're just grabbing as much as you can and leaving another corpse a little further away with a little less stuff on it, hoping you can just corpse-pile your way out of a hairy spot with said leather straps.Despite how negative this all sounds, I'm just trying to give feedback to the devs. There's a lot to like about this game and I can't wait till it's been worked on a little longer!  It scratches that same itch that Medieval Dynasty does, but there's a lot more life in this game's world and you have better control of your workers and there seems to be a lot more variety in terms of armour and weapons and quests so far.  Villages are bustling and bandits are roaming.  I most definitely recommend it if you like Medieval Dynasty type games, check it out!!",Recommended,Early Access Review

Its a lot of fun and I definitely plan to continue playing. The villages are a lot better than in most settlement games in terms of doing task. A few things that could use improvement:1. How quickly food spoils. It's hard to go off exploring when your food spoils so quickly and your villagers need food. Maybe this will improve once I recruit someone in the future who can hunt. I don't know, but its frustrating.2. Resources like trees and stone don't respawn even after a few seasons. This can be a tad frustrating due to having to go further and futher from camp. Which actually wouldn't bother me if the inventory has more space. Maybe that unlocks further down the game, but at the moment is makes the beginnings difficult.3. Bow and arrows, I am having zero luck hunting deer. I shoot one arrow and by the time I reload and shoot the thing has ran away. This is frustrating during winter and my people are hungry. I need the meat to feed them since I cant forage.4.  Every time I go into combat the game lags really badly and I end up taking hits while my screen is lagged. It's also shut the game down a few times.Outside of these things, I'm still having a good time going on quest, building, and overall survival aspects of the game. Combat is interesting because you really need a companion with you if you intend to take on more than 2 bandits. Sometimes I just want to go off solo-ing but I'm also still pretty low grade on weapons and equipment.  So more to follow on that.Definitely recommend the game and hopefully we will see some improvements since it is still in EA.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Kinda challenging when you see some enemies to have infinite stamina and ♥♥♥ torpedo in their asses (Some of them are FASTBOYYS)- Can build villages and control it's recruits from workers to guards and vice-versa, buildings are average for now and I REALLY REALLY wish that the research tree grows. Like it doesn't stay in the stone age, so you can craft more village improvements (Dreaming of castles and such).- Currency feels ok, you got money, renown and trust. I wouldn't change it, feels good.- Your recruits has a variety of attributes to improve depending of what they do, feels good but id like to see that they can learn skills or traits. Still good tho.CONS.- If you are expecting a quick game play, wait for a mod or go next game. Recruits go as fast as a snail when working (movement speed), seriously they should be able to walk normally unless they are cumbered or carry something heavy which is understandable.- Due to the slow pace of things, early game can be hard if you dont equip correctly.- You will have a hard time with your recruits vs bandits, they seem to react faster and be better organized but i guess its normal, otherwise it would be to easy.I wish the best to this game, i hope to see churches, castles, mounted paladins what ever.

Terdle,20.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Terdle/,"May 4, 2024",0,"If you're expecting a combination of medieval dynasty, mount & blade and valheim,DO NOT BUY!This game tries to be that, but isn't. Atm it is very buggy, highly unstable and severely lacks content. It's many systems need fine-tuning, the game screams optimization required and some area's just need to be redone or removed. For example:- The food system is horrible, it goes the VALHEIM route for food and foodbuffs. But food spoils waaaaay too fast, your villagers will eat it before you get any of it, unless you cook it yourself. And even then in a single game day your food will have spoilt. So you can't prepare for big fights, or plan activities in the game out other than hunting and cooking food. Unless you dont mind running around without food buffs. Yes there are ways to improve the spoil timers, however these options dont become available untill you have finished the game. Meanwhile some research requires food, that's not the problem though, your villagers will eat food from any container including your research bench. Do the villagers get buffs for eating the food? Nope. They have a different food system and have hunger, unlike the player. - The combat system is just simply bad. The MOUNT & BLADE style combat has been done many times over by other games. And i've experienced better versions in all of them. It's slow, unresponsive and lacks impact. The different weapon types don't really affect damage output, only tier seems to matter. Tier 1 weapon vs tier 2 armor, you notice less damage done/taken regardless of weapon type. Not to mention the NPC AI. I'll be honest here, mount & blade designed their gameworlds in favor of bad ai, so it wouldn't stand out. But as this game is trying to be multiple games combined, it definitely stands out. Enemy AI is easily kited over and around walls. Small height differences will completely disable their melee abilities. Meanwhile your villager AI is too dumb to pick up weapons from a weapons rack (which is specificly designed for this purpose) and will run around like headless chickens, waiting to be slaughtered... or ignore the call to arms, and simple keep on working while a raid is going on.- Content and attention to detail. One of the simple but noticeable things MEDIEVAL DYNASTY shines at. In medieval dynasty, you can pick up items in the gameworld. From barrels and knives stuck decoratively around a village, to random points of interests on the map. Everything in Medieval dynasty is interactable. This game has none of that. Every building is a static piece of decor, there is 0 interaction. Other than it being a menu. An axe on the floor is floor decoration, you loot via chests. A door is a door, but not one you can walk through. A treasure chest in a camp is just decoration. Even the npc's you kill, you don't loot their armor or weapons or even have a chance to.  Defensive walls you can build, aren't extendable. The hitboxes are too big to place them close enough together to make it actually resemble a wall. Houses aren't customisable like MD does. There is no survival. The questing is highly generic and bland. And the building of buildings is extremely tedious. Insanely tedious. All in all, i cannot recommend this game. Skip this game.Unless you're very bored.Especially at this price point, it's way to expensive for what it offers.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

Voncrow,25.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198039522011/,"May 4, 2024",0,"Combat is good (similar to Warband) and the building mechanics are pretty decent albeit arduous. It can take an excessive amount of materials to get things started and it takes quite some time to gather them and build up the actually buildings or craft items. However, your companions can do everything for you (fighting, crafting, building, gathering) based on a rimworld style order priority menu. Allow you to actually do the parts of the game you like and let your companions handle the part you don't (or at least have two hands to do it faster). Plus, when I say arduous, I'm not being exclusively negative. There is a feeling of accomplishment once you really start to get your settlement grown and it can be devastating when raiders bring it to ruin.There's more that could be said about the current state of the game, and there is certainly more stuff for the developers to work on. However, if you always wanted to play Conan Exiles in SP this is the game for you. The core gameplay loop is already well established and I could foresee myself easily doubling my current playtime if not continuing on longer. I look forward to seeing what the donkey crew does from here.",Recommended,Early Access Review

The game is pretty good, but needs more work, some of the things i find painful show up at the 3rd tier of building, where buildings get stuck in the ground so door ways or gates are inaccessible, which cause problems for your AI, although the building skeleton doesn't indicate these issues when placing (tier 3 buildings also take alot of time to put up so its frustrating to me.) I find the defense system lacking and the AI for your followers defending weak currently, better controls needed.

starman01,147.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197978314794/,"May 4, 2024",0,"If you like slow paced survival games, medieval settings, and don't mind the grind that comes with survival games, you will most likely enjoy this game. It's early access, and a bit rough around the edges mostly in terms of balancing, but it's fun to struggle to make the community survive. It's also forgiving atm because there is no starving or permadeath of your townsfolk or you neither, and if you die, you just have to pick up your drop items at the place of death. Foods adds bonuses.Some animations are really lovely, animals animation too and they react as you would expect in real life (which makes hunting with your crappy first bow quite a challenge), and the building system is nicely done (with much effort actually ) to give a great sense of accomplishment. You do not simply place them down, but you have to deliver the materials (of course), and then you need to erect the building step by step with a little effort by clicking several build points (dozend in later stage buildings). Early buildings are placed quickly, later buildings need you (and the others) to use hammers to slowly build it up, can become quite a piece of work actually. The game has a really huge research tree, which motivates you to move forward, though of course you have to grind for the research costs (materials only, and some personal attributes sometimes)Every few days (10 ? Didn't count it)  you have 2 or 3 days of winter, which looks really nice (luckily no hard freeze mechanic yet) and it makes surviving harder since nothing grows, you have to go on the hunt or trade stuff.Game map is quite large and feels alive, also the game has fast travel, but you need to build the fast travel points yourself. The game also has some sort of Conquest system to liberate villages from the current lords soldiers, i guess you are supposed to be rebel against him and ally the villages... Haven't gotten there yet though, soldiers are quite strong, and I need to build up a lot first. The villages itself have a reputation system that you need to level up to hire people.Some Cons of course, especially since it's EA, will certainly get fixed later. - currently food mechanic sometimes feels tedious. Villagers eat a bit much, and if they have nothing to eat, they don't work but wonder around in search of food, which sucks in the winter since they can't find any (haven't tried out the hunter yet). But if you set up fast travel, and have harvested in the summer, you can sell items for food. Prepare for the fact that gathering food is currently a larger job. If you take a person as follower, they will leave you when they get hungry, that's a bit annoying, but i expect some adjustment here in the future. - combat feels still a bit cluncky, also your equipment progession is slow like the rest, so at the beginning you are really squishy. Game is using a directional combat system, which needs to get a bit used to, but I started to like it (still difficult though)- The Game is meant to expand and create outposts, large trees for logs do not reqrow currently, small trees do, and you will need lots of wood. For logs you need to plan some logistic in the later game. Not a big fan of that personally, since it requires me to remove the forest in my settlement location which makes the landscape a bit dull. But the map is huge, and lot of wood around.- Performance definitly need some improvement. I have a Ryzen 5 7600X and 32 GB RAM, but my GPU is only a GeForce GTX 1060 with 6 GB.... The visuals seem to be build around the upscaling technoloy, like I encountered first in Jedi Survivor, and at least on my system it's not always extremly pretty. But I found that setting texture size to ""medium"" and upscaling to ""high"", it creates a decent look. Could be better, but the game is certainly not ugly... Still room for improvements, some pop-in etc. Some people report crashings, but on PC it's really dependend on the systems. Played 35 hours, crashed only ONCE.Overall, since I'm a huge survival game fan, i would give this game currently a 7/10. Can recommend it.",Recommended,Early Access Review

PsyayaVT,29.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197966371618/,"May 4, 2024",0,"Honestly, when you launch an early access title focused around using npcs to automate things, the ONE thing you have to get right is NPC AI. After almost 30 hours in this game, the amount of frustration i have with npc behaviour cannot easily be summarized in a review without dragging on too much. Suffice to say, i cannot in good faith recommend getting the game at this time. AI and automation needs more time to cook.So then, why the positive review? Becouse the game is AMAZING, and scratches every itch i've had for a similiar game since i burned out on Medieval Dynasty. It has incredible potential, and i feel like the dev studio is onto something really cool here, so i chose to leave a positive review becouse i believe in the vision. (There is also the slight chance that i just suck at setting up automation priorities, and that the npc ai isnt as bad as i think xD)I believe we have something truly special here, and that if they iron out the kinks that cause npc's to shove pickaxes up their donuts never to be seen again and walk off into the sunset with your recources only to die to bandits, this game will shine like the sun and stars.Get it if you believe in the vision, or if you wanna gamble on me sucking at automation (which is likely).

After some research online I was able to get them up and running for a little longer, but they stopped again after around day 20-ish. I can't grow my population above 4 because at that point food is so limiting I have spend all my time gathering food, or grinding resources instead of questing for renown. In regards to the pathing: villagers get stuck on buildings, can't get to food in traps (I spent 5 minutes laughing my toosh off because a villager would simply walk around a trap and get stuck over and over and over and .... you get the point).

I built my shelter. Talked to the elder, talked to the girl, talked to the hunter, built the hunter a shelter, went back to the hunter, and wasn't given the option to say I had built him a shelter. I thought I had to build him a shelter by his campfire. When I gathered materials I saw a different shelter when I opened the build menu. Wasn't sure if it was that I wasn't by his campfire or I didn't build the other shelter. Built it by his campfire. It takes to long to run back and forth I went to the last save it was before I talked to the village elder. I'm not spending this much time on a game I have to figure out and go back that far when I mess up cause it wasn't explained.ProsGood graphics. Seems like it could be a really good game.ConsNo stacking materials in inventory and very limited spots.Building!   A. I had to run around the shelters like 20 times to build them. If this is how they want the game to be it could actually be cool. However there were times I didn't know what it wanted me to do and I'm not sinking hours into getting it wrong and trying to figure it out. B. I needed logs for the villager shelter.

Some sort of explanation? -A tutorial for what I need to build, how to build it, and how to gather the materials would be needed for me to get back into it. With the hunter it would't even need to be a full on tutorial but something in the objectives. Build the hunter a villager shelter. Something?Stamina should regen if I'm still holding shift.

But, as it stands they have all the stuff that can help you progress, good villagers, something besides a starter bow, good armor, a lot of buildings, locked behind liberating a village. But liberating a village requires trust and the quests for the trust are locked behind having villagers you can only get AFTER liberating a village. I am currently stuck in Blackridgepool trying to get some idiots GLUE back from a ARMY of bandits that outclass anything I can throw at them. I have to friend Blackridgepool to progress with Haerndean (The starter town) but to befriend Blackridgepool I need materials you cannot make until you liberate a village......Which I cannot do because I cannot complete the quests to earn trust..... Additionally the glue sniffing bandits at aforementioned camp re spawn at such a ludicrous rate you cannot fight them. I even have a cheese perch to shoot them in the face point blank and have cleared all but 2 of them before running out of the physical limit of arrows my inventory allows and  some archer one shots me in the best armor I can physically make. Some intermediate bows and arrows would be great. Something besides the literal starter weapon. The game has a terrible circular balance issue that is not currently fun. It is annoying, frustrating, maddening and condusive to only looking for the best way to cheese a fight. There are many ways to address it and it befuddles me as to why it is an issue at all. The villagers you can get are terrible in combat and only good to distract long enough for you to whack bandits in the back. Very much not a fan of the current blocking mechanic either. AI are perfect blockers but the mechanic for you is awkward at best. Game has HUGE potential but HUGE flaws at the same time.

Some players just prefere to not be kept away from building and developing by those constant waves of attacks and the need to defend the liberated villages. You should have the possibility to only have to free the villages one time and keep them afterwards without the fights against more incoming brigades. That was the only thing that really annoyed the hell out of me after about 100 hours in game and it was not easy to force myself to go on, because I really love the rest of the game.I know for a lot of people it might be boring to play on peaceful mode, but the developers should add it to have more buyers, because this is the only thing that would motivate me to strongly not recommend this game.

Cromulent,109.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198273730947/,"May 1, 2024",0,"This game is fun and addictive. It's a good blend of survival, settlement building, combat (mount & blade style), and exploration. The world is handcrafted and aesthetically pleasing if you like nature. The NPCs are represented accurately to the intended historical time period and geographic region. I'm only to the end of tier 1 technology at this point and have only explored less than 1/4 of the map (I'm trying not to rush the tech tree), so hopefully it will continue to be good at higher tiers. Performance and visuals are pretty good (so far) on a 1080 ti @ 1080p, with a mix of high and medium (lighting and visual effects) settings. I was getting some frequent game crashes when using TSR upscaling, but no crashes with TAA, although I'm not 100% sure if this was causing the issue. I don't really mind the use of AI voices for minor NPCs if it allows the devs to use the resources for more gameplay content (more unique voice lines, quests, POIs, assets, etc). Some tutorials would be nice to add regarding how to manage your companions relating to preparation for battle. For example, you can command your squad to access storage for them to auto drop off resources and to auto load out food, weapons and shields. It would be nice to be able to designate certain companions to prefer archer load out, and reduce any other necessary micromanagement. I hope the devs are able to complete this game successfully, but the early access content is already pretty cool.",Recommended,Early Access Review

elev8ing,18.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/elev8ing/,"May 1, 2024",0,"TLDR: Early Access game, totally worth $30 to me personally. Has potential to be amazing maybe 6 months-a year down the road.I'm about 10 hours in so far. I have 4 companions, starting my first outpost as soon as this review is done, and finally getting enough food to thrive. The game system is super cool, reminds me of a Valheim+Enshrouded clone, with the whole companion system of Medieval Dynasty, and combat like Mount & Blade. Slow grind, (I still don't have a full set of tools) but honestly one of the first games that setting a rabbit trap and getting a rabbit feels super rewarding. I really had to work for it. AI is super cool, you basically set them certain jobs, and they just start working (similar to Palworld almost?). I've been really enjoying it. I was hesitant, but am super happy I caved and bought it. Absolutely worth $30 in my book.Cons: -Some bugs/QoL changes are needed... For example, food spoils ridiculously fast until you get to mid/late game, arrows sometimes just straight up pass through something, waypoints on the map don't work. Mostly little things. It's an EA game, to be expected, and I'm sure most will be fixed.-The AI voices are awful. Sounds like the cheapest AI voices you could possibly get, kind of kills immersion and personality for every NPC. (EDIT: heard this is a placeholder just for early access, if so, awesome!)-Again, waypoints in the map seem to not work for me? Like I just have to open the map every once in awhile and make sure i'm going the right direction. It does have fast travel signs, which will probably eliminate the need for that, but it's a con for sure.-Dev is supposedly kind of iffy... Just looking around on reddit, a lot of people think this game will be dropped and not get out of EA. I will say, look on the community hub on steam - Devs have had a daily update since it came out. They seem to be fixing bugs and adjusting things left and right, and I have no worries about it.",Recommended,Early Access Review

There is a lot of positives to the game such as the building looks good(I would like to see maybe when you place a piece your worker or player actually picks it up and sets in place rather than it just falling into place if that makes sense), combat is fun reminds me of Mount and Blade(maybe see options to put them into formations later on? Possibly mounts?), seems to be a lot of crafting options which is great, overall it's really fun and I really do lose track of time playing. There are definitely improvements that need to be made such as the AI for the workers, being able to swim, sneak, and some other things. One thing I noticed was when I posted someone as a guard they eventually wouldn't eat anything, revert back to a worker to eat and stay as a worker. Not a huge deal because there's such a huge heads up when a raid is incoming I just rally everyone in my village anyways. I really would like to see a sneak option mainly for hunting. I am not too far into the game but I hope there's an option to make roads because not having any paths throughout my village doesn't look as good. Also, straps are a little hard to come by, I understand you can eventually make them yourself, but having to hunt down bandits and get raided everyday after raiding another bandit camp is somewhat annoying just to hopefully obtain enough straps for research and crafting. I do love this game so far though and hope the developers keep releasing updates because I do see improvements everyday.

GlassForestFox,13.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GlassForestFox/,"April 30, 2024",0,"Sort of subverts expectations from a traditional survival game, by replacing the classic hunger/thirst meter in favor of it just affecting how much health and stamina you have...or relying on the community of NPCs you recruit to do a lot of the heavy lifting for you.I also really like that Fast Travel isn't readily available and is something you have to work up to, research, and build your own little travel points as you slowly explore the world and stretch your reach further across the lands, it makes me feel like I'm actually experiencing a world and not just being dropped in a playground.The basis for the combat is pretty solid, reminds me a bit of Kingdom Come Deliverance, but I do feel that no matter how much you improve the combat just feels unbalanced, sure you can take companions with you making combat easier overall, but even lower level bandits can just predict your movement too well and deal butt loads of damage in seconds making you feel like you haven't improved at all.  Maybe that's just me, but I do tend to fall back on archery a lot as the close quarters combat just feels off.Quests are okay at best, sometimes it just feels like a lot of fetch questing, some of it directly ties into helping you learn the game rather than making you slog through a tutorial (which I personally enjoy), but a decent amount almost feels like ""make item A; bring back; profit"", and then again there are some decent little stories that get told too.  A bit of a hit or miss situation for sure, and I do hope they diversify it a little more in the future.If you're looking for a neat little town building survival adjacent medieval game for a decent price, I could honestly suggest worse games than this, I hope they leave the AI stuff behind for sure, but honestly I've been enjoying my time with it and playing with friends can be a lot of fun too.",Recommended,Early Access Review

I appreciate details in games, but maybe focus on the bugs in the game (like when you shoot a guy with a shield 30 times in the face without dealing damage) before you make me build a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ barn (literally) ONE PLANK AT A TIME.

Now, since you can add villagers to help you complete tasks, surely they could help build? WRONG.

Foraging, Lumbermill, mine you need to constantly make sure there is a queue and you have the tools. Foraging building they won't gather reeds so must be close to a lake/pond if you want them to gather, or run yourself.

It has a lot of potential.Some things that needs to be updated or developed. Visual effects:Villagers needs to be doing jobs at villages. They just walked around the base, which doesn't make it feel immersive. Can't have a farmer title, but not seen tending to the farm and instead you're running laps. Also, maybe let the villagers also sell stuff as well and not just the merchant and bookseller. Update the rock hatchet to look like a rock hatchet. It's early on, so I'm assuming this will get addressed eventually. Still want to note that weapons visuals are important.User Guides:Maybe update the index to tell you about user guides on how to craft an acquired item. I feel that the game is slowed down drastically because there's no info. I just started, but I don't know how to get ropes and cords besides fighting and pillaging all the bandits camps into non-existence. Not that I don't mind. I don't know what else to do with pelts and hides. Feels like it should translate to having a tannery and creating leather for armor and such. Having fur from wolves can translate to warm clothes. Mechanics:Winter is a thing where plants die and you survive on animal traps and hunting. However, that's just it. Winter does nothing and doesn't freeze you or have any effect. Feels a bit non-realistic and less immersive. Eating is a thing to increase your health bars and stamina, but you never require a drink thats considered a must have for humans to survive. Probably add that in.I ran around the map as well hoping that since you run A LOT, your agility would increase. No, it does not. Cooking gives exp for cooking. Crafting gives crafting exp. But running does zip. Hard to translate it. maybe give agility some exp like ARK. It doesn't have to be a lot of exp. Make it so that it's worth while to invest in buying the books, besides that seems like the only way to do it so far. Would like a sneak or crouch option. Seems like enemies can detect you within a vicinity and there's no detection mechanics. It's like an auto-detection with 5m radius kind of thing, even though I'm behind bushes and trees. Then follow up with a mechanic where deers or animals can smell you if they can't see you, but with the higher the hunting the better you are at getting closer. You can even go wild and add in the updraft and down draft mechanics to make it even more challenging.Will play more to get a better understanding and progress more, but these are my current thoughts on it.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Specs:4080FE super12900k (water cooled)32gb ram 5200mhz DDR5storage - M.2 980 samsung Pros:- Environment- companion system is neat (reminds me of conan)- Decent performance for my pc (specs above)- questing- blocking is similar to for honor- doesn't abuse your time- simplistic UI designCons:- combat system needs a lot of work as its clunky atm- building isn't full customization as its all pre-set blueprintsThis is just what I have seen so far but I will update as I play but I understand this is a point where the game functions and now they will compile so Im excited to see where it goes.I am enjoying this game and it makes me feel like its a city builder in 3rd person and I hope end game will get chaoticI am also hoping to see horses and carts at some point so we can travel the what seems to be fairly large map.,Recommended,Early Access Review

Taking into consideration it is in early access, the game is very good, only in need of improvement regarding combat (needs more polish and IMO needs to be less confusing) and maybe in regards to mob and fauna variety. Also it would be perfect if there were mounts in the game and animal husbandry. All in all, a very good early access game with plenty to do and to learn.

Rhuin,72.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198010771112/,"April 29, 2024",0,"The best thing I can equate it to is a fantasy Stranded: Alien Dawn but you play as Henry from KCD as one of survivors. The priority systems are intuitive if you're familiar with that kind of thing and the NPC companions, though not super efficient, actually do what they are supposed to. The core game play loop is fun and the escalating raiding parties give a sense of urgency around advancement. I played a couple starts to get a feel for it and found that actually recruiting a couple NPCs and then spending the time around camp investing in the automation helped advance much quicker as I could go do my own thing (quests, trading, etc) and the NPCs could keep producing but I think to avoid it getting ""grindy"" early on, the key is not to grab too many too quickly as feeding them all before systems are in place can be time consuming.Combat is a little janky and unforgiving but once you get better weapons and a couple early skill points, starts to feel much better. Haven't progressed to the point of larger scale battles but at the 4v4, 4v6 level its both challenging and, occasionally frustrating as you realise your archers are carrying hoes instead of bows because you didn't send them to arm themselves first. Would definitely recommend if you can live with the imperfections but would just as easily say wait and see if the voices are immersion breaking for you. If this title garners the support to see it through to release, it has the potential to be something really special. My biggest complaint/suggestion at the moment is that the limited number of save files does make saving feel like a resource too, especially when undertaking risky expeditions.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Ederoi,54.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198059969769/,"April 29, 2024",0,"So I don't normally write reviews but I felt like this game really deserves one. Being in early access I think this game is amazing. I wouldn't really consider it a survival game as its missing some core aspects of one like hunger, thirst, etc, but it does really well without those.  Graphics wise its not the best looking game out there, but what it lacks there it more than makes up for in it's game-play. This game is a slow burn. You start off small and it takes a lot of time to start getting to the meat, which in my opinion is awesome. This is not some fantasy medieval game where you get super strong and everything is just quick action packed combat.  Combat can be slow and the better heavy armors have you move a bit more realistically. I love the archery in this game. Aiming drains stamina, arrows can fly off target, and you can't just fling arrows down range without carefully aiming at your target and adjusting for fall off. Raids are a constant threat and fending them off makes stronger more difficult ones follow in retaliation. If you happen to fail fending of the bandits raiding you the raid tier drops giving you some breathing room to fend off the next one or couple while to build your town and yourself to take on the harder ones. Directional combat is not something I'm used to but it was not difficult to get the hang of and adds so much more to combat especially one on one fights. Building and settlement management needs some polish but the foundation is there and it works. the later tiers really got some love as you build to framework of every building watching it develop from an empty lot to a nice rustic building that fits the the rest of the game. The story is engaging but the voices of the NPC's make it a bit underwhelming. Most of the NPC's sound monotone, like they are using a bot to read lines. However I have run into the occasional NPC's that are full of emotion, sadly it feels out of place since everyone else lacks that emotion. Personally I can look past all of that and I do find the story interesting and want to pursue it. I do have some complaints about this game but most are nothing major. Keeping in mind this is an early access game. There is a lot of fine tuning and polish that is needed. there have been several times where my settlers don't do what I need them to, an example of this is when setting them to guard the settlement. They will roam around and fight threats they come across but lets say a raiding party is coming from the west and all but one of your guards are elsewhere in the settlement when that one guard goes to fight five bandits by themselves the other guards will just keep roaming around like nothing is happening. Losing if never fun but losing because the agro range of your settlers is too small is something else all together. Now I haven't seen anyone else mention this so it might just be a bug. There is also a companion system that can help with this but has its own draw backs. You can give orders to your settlers but I found that you can only do this when they are set to companion.Overall I do think this game is worth the price tag there is a lot here and though it needs some work you can easily spend 100 hours playing this as is. Please note that I have been playing by myself so I have not experienced the co-op. From what I hear and read in other places the co-op does work and is just as fun as playing solo if not more. Also this review is my just my opinion and view of the game, I might be wrong about certain things because of how I play or my understanding of its mechanics. One last note to the Dev's, I can't hit the stupid birds to save my life please add traders that sell feathers. if there already is I haven't found them.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Yes, the battle controls are a little wonky, but, it still shows off great. The ""collisions/havesting"" can use a little love, but, once again, not too harsh as of now. Survival games are in my wheelhouse, so this game is right up my alley. Albeit that some of the stuff you need to gather you need to find and how to find it, but that's what makes the game so great so far. Figuring out where everything is.I'm still not to sure about the hunting aspect of the game, seems a little too harsh for right now, I know the devs have worked on it and made it a little easier, but, without a sneak function, I dont think many will try their hand at hunting. I haven't had a chance to hunt yet, but i've saw others mention about the same thing. I hope they fix or make it a little more easier to hunt.

The reviews about poor explanation of certain things at the start have some truth to it but like not knowing how to pick things up etc, I do wonder if these people have ever played a game like this before because everything has seemed fairly common sense or similar to other survival type games eg medieval dynasty.The most annoying thing ive ran into however so far is the need for straps that appear only to be dropped by Bandits. I think the bandit/raid bits could be built on and for sure every crafting item should be able to be foraged/farmed/crafted in some way and not rely on random drops (within reason anyway, maybe some exceptional items should be from drops).All in all seems to have great potential, and the updates and bug fixes appear to be coming daily.

Bambi Sol,63.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198029714528/,"April 29, 2024",1,"Very enjoyable game that has great potential.HOWEVER : Very worried about developer and publisher track record, read other comments to understand why.Early access : game will crashEarly access : I wait 1 minute after loading for graphics to tune in and stop laggingHave played over 30hours at the moment, game is slow paced with enjoyable developpement. Did a lot of grinding at the start untill I understood how game worked, villagers working for you is a must. Research and tier progress are visible from the start.At the beginning i was worried about build location, turns out, this game is great for ""outposts"" and different hubs.You start with needing X-Y ressources such as Flax  then with new technology you need Z-W ressources such as wheat or mud, moving to different forms or worked produce. Basically, start with gathering and move towards trading and farming ... etc.The systems are built with progress in mind, plan your path accordingly, don't research something you can't use.Exploration and combat are nice, huge map with a few nice encouters. Story base quest is also an interesting feature, helping you discover important items such as signs to fast travel. Although the stamina system exists, I would prefer being able to sprint out of combat for much longer, this is walk simulator even with 3x good food (different foods grow and help stamina/health bar max/regeneration)Combat is similar to mount and blade directional control. It's somewhat clunky at start and although it does get better with attributes agility/strengh or 2hand/1hand it still needs adjusting. (Xp gain towards attribute aswell in my opinion ?)Would like to see romance options, with village feudes and more -/+ options for trust with villages. Maybe thieving ressources as an option or pickpocketing ? Would love some of that juicy hemp from the neighbours. This is a slow grind game, i'm only about to advance to tier 2 now with 35hours gameplay and 9 villagers working for me.Would like to see influence from games such as the Guild or mount and blade a little more. Religion with according buildings and exchanges could be added. Medieval life was indeed very if not completly influenced by that. (would also add more hubs for herbs and neutral religious sites without needing so many POI's for a random seller)Professions, as in companions are important (and require a little tech to get to) so hopefully they will build on that with ""familys/dynasties"" trying to control certain areas and ressources.Loved the idea of the voting quest for an elder, could play on that..The bandit farm where you get wheat is a great idea, would love to see that developed - Imagine a village controlling all the wheat production in your area and without feud or alliance can't trade/get grain and so can't upgrade to next tier ...Will add more info as I play. I hate the stamina with sprinting. I've auto walked further than I want to admit to just explore. (please add auto run, out of combat ?)",Recommended,Early Access Review

The building is basic, you just plop a shape and get the stuff. It's not pretty and allows only base customization from placing buildings, but there are a lot of buildings, and the game emphasizes more on multiple bases over spending forever in 1 location.Workers and stuff seem to work great, and take a ton of the work load.

I read a lot of reviews and the negative scared me away but i bought it anyway. What I like about the game so far is that the npc followers aren't just there, they actually do stuff. i read in reviews that they let food burn etc. What I have learned is unlike MD the skill of the follower matters if its a 0 you get a 0 worth of work. I like the building it isn't to bad because you can set everything up and leave your followers to do all the work. The amount of mats req isn't bad either, graphics are like any other game in its genre. Now what has ruffled my feathers is the over all mechanics of battle and leveling up to go from lvl 2 to 3 you have to get like 1200 exp and getting that exp from doing it takes a very long time. Battle is awful to me i swing i miss they swing they hit. the raids are weird and hard i was in a lvl 1 area and had 3 guys come one bower two with iron weapons my crew was still working with clubs lol it was like day 4. i lost everything as the respawn time is 30s. it does give you time to prepare. there isn't a clear explanation of how to recruit followers or heal them when they fall in battle. bandages take a bit to get unlocked. I think there should be a better intro not just boom your out there that can be frustrating to people new to these types of games. reed is needed to unlock many things which to the east of the first town is a lake you can find it but its surrounded by wolves and boars. Stamina recovery rate is a bit on the slow side and bandits seem to not lose it when chasing you. overall I like the game and I hope they continue it.",Recommended,Early Access Review

While they have made some significant improvement to the game that it is now playable, maybe even borderline enjoyable. The npcs are still insanely stupid, which can be extremely annoying at times, but they did make fairly good improvements to the general playability. Even though the game still has some major flaws. For example everyone can cut down trees and turn them into planks, but it takes a lumberjack to build a house.. I'm sure there is some logic to it that I just can't figure out.But about the npcs, they have really hard time with basic tasks. They have a rating which is supposed to affect which tasks they prioritize, far as I can tell, this has no affect what so ever. They are also ridicilously slow and stupid in general (they might pick up a hammer do one time build on a building under construction and then take the hammer to the farthest stockpile even when there are few right next to the site with space on them).The stupidity goes also to the bandits or whatever enemies you find. If you can find a rock just tall enough that you cant run on top of it (requires jumping) you are basically safe. Only the archers can hit you and unless there are a lot of them, you can easily evade their arrows and kill them one by one, after which you have easy time dealing with the melee units. Basically you can solo any camp this way (most with the tier 1 bow and arrows). Because the npcs are stupid as mentioned earlier, construction process can take a lot of time. First of all the later tier buildings require a ton of material. However the most painful part is the actual construction phase. They have put some real effort in to this, meaning that basically you have to hammer each and every board into place. In a way this is great, and would make the npcs actually useful if they were up to the task. But as mentioned they might just hit that one nail and leave, which means that it can take days to build a simple barn for example.However I'm positive that they will fix this in the future and seeing that the game is now actually playable, I would go as far as to recommend it. Wouldn't pay the full price, but if you get it on sale, then I would say it's worth it.",Recommended,Early Access Review

They will walk around and do the tasks per the priority level and base needs.You build relationships and earn favor with the local townships, recruit and work with them to address the regional issues they face (quests) - Bandits, wildlife, survival, trade. The map is very big, and thankfully they add a fast travel option once you get a bit into the game.Co-op works very well and is very snappy, a good net code. Responsiveness feels like single player pretty much all the time. The game has some client stability issues (crash to desktop) for me, but I think that is not a co-op issue and more of a patch being needed.There are some quality of life changes I would consider to be big improvements, like inventory stacking (make it like chests where theres a max total of capacity that isnt bound by the physical inventory box UI).AI could use some tweaking, the directional combat isnt bad, archery is a big challenge (as it should be considering the power). The overall progression ramp could use some tweaking, the progression for skills, weapons, and other stats coupled with the book learning system, and needing to hire specialists to advance your colony are all a bit bizarre and unnecessary.Bandits are a little robotic in their movements and the AI placeholder voices are a bit off-putting. I would love if they hire a few amazing voice over actors to nail this game. You do interact a lot with the townsfolk and bringing more life into that part of the game would be an amazing change.Would recommend for sure, a good showing for just coming out in EA, am hoping they carry on with it, because its pretty good value at this price point. Just be on look out for weird bugs, as there are plenty.",Recommended,Early Access Review

This is a gem for sure, just needs some polishing. the being said... if youre not an experianced rimworld player with an advanced understanding of jobs and priorities... i can see you have a really hard time with the npcs and getting certain tasks done.The combat is clunky, but has a lot of potential to be very much like chivalry. They need to work on melee weapon ranges. it feels kinda off, but you get used to it. Swords feel like daggers to me.

Chronic,85.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198039186598/,"April 28, 2024",0,"I dont give many review's, however this game deserves one. Definitely worth the price, these indy games are beating most AAA games. I only put 7 hours in but I will sink thousands I promise.I sunk over a thousand hours in Medieval Dynasty and when this game is poliished and finished, will out surpass it by far. I already want to put my time in this game over it. Pro:- Building is easy, some glitches but obviously this is new game- gathering resources is a grind, until you get your companions.- there are tons of wild animals to kill and be killed by- tons of settlements you have to take over- you get attacked every once in awhile which keeps you on your toes- you can form your own army with your companions. - companions can be either guards, in your army, or made to work- I Havent tried the Multiplayer, but it has that aswellLastly, I play on a so so decent laptop HAHA, and it runs well on Low-Medium settings. Cons:- definitely a grind on some mats, and definitely learn to survive attacks. Could use a little more survival by food and water, and weather and other elements.- Little glitches here and there but remember, its new and the devs are really active.- Graphics are clunky but thats ok because I work mostly on a Laptop and it functions perfectly fine on  medium settings. (AMD Radeon 560x) lol I know. Buy me a gaming computer if you dont like it, but hey, I can play any AAA game on it, and thats all that counts. Edit: Still playing and devs are still updating. There is lots of content for this being alpha stage to keep you busy. 80 hours, and I've hardly scratched the surface with this game. Still not enough, however if you join discord you can follow along and see all the up coming updates and what the devs are working on.*Put it this way. If you like a game that you dont have to rely on having to drink and eat to keep you alive, but only building a fortress from getting attacked, manage NPCs of your town that become slaves for you, and will guard. Management is meh, but you can get used to it. Once you get enough companions you really dont have to worry about it much. Only just managing your army once its time to kickass.You can go out attack other NPC forts, either small or large. They all have different difficulties depending how far you've advanced. Dying only drops your loot but you can go back and pick it up. NPCS when they raid your town will take come of your loot but you can kill them and take it back.

Dorael021,94.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stevenc021/,"April 27, 2024",0,"Here's my honest thoughts for this game. It's not perfect of course, but it's solid and for the time being I would say its worth it. i can easily see this being anywhere from 50-100 hours depending on how much effort you put in to it. Which is reasonable for the price point.Pros: -Combat is fun. It's a little janky at first but once you get used to it it's not too bad. So far I've managed to clear some smaller bandit camps solo without companions. Can essentially fight 2 maybe 3 alone and make it out in one piece.- Overall companion AI is decent. It has some quirks to it, but if you prioritize things appropriately they'll do what you want them to do. Remember, 1 is highest prio, 9 is lowest. So use that to your advantage. They'll gather food and cook if it's higher priority, and do other jobs once you've met the quotas you've set for the gathering/cooking.Cons: - Honestly the world feels a little bland at times. There's plenty of quests and things to do, but for the most part it seems pretty mild mannered in the beginning. I haven't gotten far enough in to say if it gets more interesting.That's the biggest things I can think of. I know this company has a bad rap for previous titles they've had issues with. However, this isn't a 60 dollar game, and as far as I'm concerned it's fun enough as is to get my moneys worth.",Recommended,Early Access Review

I feel a crouch option as well as the ability for foliage (bushes and trees) to obfuscate their sight to allow for getting closer, as trying to get the upper hand is more or less using a bow and arrow from afar and hoping your shot is a headshot.

At its roots, it is a survival game, but layered on top of that is the feeling of games like Rimworld character prioritizations and town building.  It could be hard to love this game if you aren't a big survival fan and only play games like Rimworld on the higher speeds.  The biggest downfall for that side of things is the lack of speed controls since you are at a single pace with your singular character leading the rest.  You can rest at night to quickly bypass their sleep cycles though.  While it is your time to be active, you can assign others to tasks you don't like doing though and focus purely on the parts you do like for the most part.  For me, I often change what I'm in the mood for an adjust what tasks the others focus on so I can do what I want, when I want.Combat and some other mechanics like hunting could use work, but these are just small rough edges that could easily be improved built on something that has huge potential.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Cable,182.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973081581/,"April 27, 2024",0,"My earlier game review of Bellright.This is the first game I have played that successfully mixes several game styles together at a sufficient depth to each. Fighting in the game is not just block and attack. It follows a more active system of directional blocking and attacking so depending on your weapon you will have left right and overhead swings. I believe some weapons I think also have a stabbing capability. Each of these also can be blocked if timed right. There is also a hold to big attack vs quick strikes for less damage. There are also bow and arrow and you either have to dodge those attacks if possible or use a shield. Survival in the game is done in a way that makes it palatable. Foods provide buffs to health pool and stamina, Followers also need food and you all need places to sleep, armors, tools etc to thrive. There are also bandages to heal from injury. The first few steps in the game feel like Ark (minus death from hunger thirst or dinos), but that soon changes once you get into town and gain your first follower.Building and follower management. This part is very deep and I feel I am still learning how to best manage followers. They can be assigned specific tasks and are intelligent enough to go about helping finish building, gather resources, guard and fight. This level of simulation works so well they really feel like an asset to your overall goals. They each have attributes similar to yours and some are better than others at various activities. There is also a cap to the attributes so some followers may never be able to reach the highest skill. Some even have bonuses to skills so you will find rolls for them to fit into, like researching, gathering, hunting, trapping, building, farming, making items, mining, fighting etc. RPGI found the storyline compelling as it is told through intro video and NPCs along the way as well as lore papers sprinkled in a few places as you explore. The character growth and attribute system is solid. You can read books (they take a long time to read) that give skill increases, but mostly you gain attributes through doiing whatever it is you are doing the most of. There are also 3 food slots that can be filled with basic foods to start and as you progress in cooking and making better foods you will notice large increase to health and stamina.  There are quests to go on and factions in the game to raise by doing various deeds. A trading system is also in place to make and spend gold. There is a feeling of progression that is really motivating to get to the next steps making this hard to just hit save and end game.Graphics and SoundThis game has great graphics. I have a 3080ti with 4k monitor. I try to play most games as high as possible. This game allows me to get there. I am not sure of fps, but it doesn't have stutter or anything game breaking and looks really good. Lighting is handled well. There is weather effects, Day, night, seasons. It feels like as close as possible to a breathing world as can be expected while also including co-op and all these other systems. Sounds are handled very well with nature sounds, angry enemies voices, villagers talking to you as you pass etc. Replay-ability This game is 100% replayable. You can have multiple saves for single player, duo and more. It has a general structure of how you play, but feels more sandbox and free with how exactly you go about things. Just as examples, one play through we hardly did quests and had only one follower, but killed alot of bandits, while another we got 3 followers and did buckets of quests furthering the main story. 2 things I could see changingWater currently is not swimmable or passable and kind of punts you back to a river bank unless you find a rock to jump over a river. I sort of see why they did this was to make decision to cross a bridge more tactical and care more risk. Also being able to duck. This may sound stupid, but I just like to duck in most games. Both are not deal breakers. Just would be a plus to realism they have going.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Combat is where I'm grinding to a halt in my play sessions, and it feels like its a shame, cause that is apparently a focus of this game... but it needs some major improvement to be more fun and engaging. Not sure the directional combat is adding anything to the experience at this point except annoyance. When having to go out and fight someone, either I really suck or the bandit has a  shield, or the enemies gear seems to be far beyond what I have unlocked, or there are simply 1 more bandits than I have people with me and it's really not very feasible with the combat system to survive engaging with more than one enemy at a time.Will come back and checkout after some time to see how it progresses.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Sum ♥,81.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198158585524/,"April 27, 2024",0,"I'm havin' a blast playing Bellwright so far.  The combat did take a bit of getting use to for me, I use a roller ball mouse (just my personal preference.) I eventually figured out to turn down the sensitivity to make the combat blocking and swinging easier after dying about 30x.  (I'm not the best gamer, so please don't judge the game for my personal lack of ""get good scrub.""  lol.  I love the crafting and building.  I absolutely adore when I can build more than one village and I can build them anywhere on the map the doesn't already have a village. I haven't tried co-op so I can't speak to that.  As a solo player I do enjoy some direction for progressing the game.  (hand holding)  but not too much.  Bellwright gives you some very basic understanding of how some things work IF you slow down and properly read the occasional pop-up.  There is no real ""tutorial"" making you try things for yourself to get a feel for it.  Which isn't a bad thing.  It grants the player the freedom to discover things on their own without excessive info dumping and tedious tutorials and constant pop-ups.That said it can be a tiny bit frustrating trying to figure out how to unlock tiers going up the technology tree.  That, again could just be my personal issue and not the game in anyway.  I think overall, Bellwright has a fantastic combination of all the bits of other games that I love all rolled into one.  Free building - you can build anywhere you want that isn't an existing village.  You can place buildings, houses, chests, storage houses anywhere.  No, North - South - East -West nonsense.  No grids that you must snap to.  I can't tell you how much I appreciate that feature.Map - A large map with lots to explore, POI's to discover.  Finding resources on the map is easy once you've opened the fog of war blacked out sections.  This makes it easy to have to remember where you saw Ore or garlic last.  You can even fast travel very close to resources if you want. (more on that below)Fully customizeable storage - I like organization.  You can quick set things your villagers will place in storage's. You can even go a step further and individually allow or disallow items, armor, seeds, etc.  Companions / villagers can learn - Either by doing or reading skill books to maximize their potential.  You can also have them craft better gear for you and themselves.  You do have to give them the gear as far as I'm aware, they won't just take better armor.  Once you get specific buildings and set what you want collected or made.  Prioritize it, your villagers will be on it.  Just a tip I learned; If you want someone to be a dedicated worker of a specific job, list '0' in the priorities list for all other jobs that villager will do.  BE WARNED do this ONLY if you have several other villagers.  If you do that, the Villager you set to do a specific job won't learn other skills unless you give them a skills book to learn from.  And because villagers aren't assigned to one specific job, they can and will be busy all day doing something to benefit the village and you.  If you set '0' to everyone, things can grind to a halt if you aren't on top of it.  I don't recommend doing this if you only have 2 villagers. Fast travel - You can build sign posts and place them along any road, right up to a village boarder for quick quest turn ins and visits. Also for easy ways to collect materials in far off places.  The only downside some might not like is your companions can't follow you.  If you're going on the offensive with your army, you have to go the distance with them.  They can run out any food buffs they had if you don't get there in time.  This can be avoided by carrying food items in your bag and giving it out to your companions just before you start your battle.  Fast travel is great, especially in early game before you can build up your stamina.  No long load times for it either. Another plus.There is so much I could go on about with Bellwright.  I am having a fantastic time playing, discovering all the mechanics, figuring out the best ways to build my starting village, finding the best people to recruit to my little rebellion, exploring the map, killing off bandits, clearing out bandit encampments.  To the developers and company involved with Bellwright:  Thank you for making a great game.  A big Thank you for listening to the community's feedback and patching bugs and making quality of life improvements - updating things so quickly.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Picture a realm where pixelated charm meets medieval madness, where every quest is a comedy and every character a caricature. It's like Medieval Dynasty and Mount & Blade had a love child, and that child was raised by a troupe of jesters.From the quirky NPCs of Bumbleberry to the absurdity of crafting bells instead of slaying dragons, ""Bellwright"" is a delightful romp through a world where the only rule is to expect the unexpected. And if you've ever found joy in the strategic depth of Medieval Dynasty or the sandbox mayhem of Mount & Blade, you'll feel right at home in this zany adventure.So, gather your party and prepare for a journey filled with laughter, absurdity, and the occasional existential crisis.

Fantastic to watch and a very real sense of accomplishment once they are constructed.Combat: The Combat is good, but fairly standard, would like to see AI spread out more when they engage and some more formations etc..Missions: Good missions not too grindy and certainly well thought out. Not overly complicated  and tiered towards where you are in the game.Dialog:Yes i read the dialog and it seem good, looking forward to hearing the none AI versions.Game Length:Finally a game that take a very long time to play and is very good at drip feeding you content.                               -------------------------------------------------------------------------------OK now The Bad:Food:There needs to be some mechanic to reduce hunger as i feel like i spend all the time eating food. Even with fine meals it's still too quick to run out.Armies:There needs to be a better way of equip and unequipping Armour and Weapons and feeding your army before you go out to fight. Maybe a separate equipment UI screen for when you add them to the army, they will look to equip the armour you have placed in there and also look for the meals that you have suggested.Raids:I like the raids, but the mechanic needs a tweek, destroying and enemy camp should reduce the raid counter/ threat timer, instead it increases which i find very strange.Difficulty Level:The difficulty level seems over high for the medium settings, which may be putting players off. The raid settings and the loot from killing mobs is very underwhelming. Need some loot drops from bosses that can give you slightly better weapons than tier 1.Walls:Please add some, if your worrying about them being exploited have them within a radius of the town hall.                ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Things i would love to see:1. Working Radius of buildings, mining camps etc..2. Better explanation of how outposts work.3. No raiding on outposts - just annoying.4. Better Food mechanics5. Better Weather mechanics6. A reason for npc's to wear cloths when they are workers.7. Comfort levels, that can speed up movement from npcs.8. Army formations9. Quick equipping when taking an NPC into the army and back to worker10.

I feel the developer has over reached their ability in wanting there to be a unique and complicated combat system. Sadly it doesn't work at all well. Swinging an ax is clumsy, slow, and feels very very awkward.

Seems like the updates since have fixed some of the basic fundamental flaws. Beyond recruiting companions, which itself is not all that unique of a feature, the game doesn't really stand out from other open world survival/builder games. Combat is still atrocious and very clunky. Progression is broken. Can't build a basic food cellar without an apprentice innkeeper which requires liberating a village, which requires an army, which requires food...I honestly go back and forth with whether I'd recommend this game or not. I guess I'll stay generous.",Recommended,Early Access Review
Ragelon,100.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199292893269/,"April 26, 2024",0,there are very few things to hate about the game to be honest. ive reached T2 with 1 friend playing with me. day 70. weve liberated a village. got us a couple apprentices. the game is slow. buut why would you want a game like this to be so fast paced. building every little post/plank at first with no hammers on ur villagers is a pain but once you reach enough villagers to beable to just have them do it while your out doing other things like hunting n such becomes far easier and actually kinda cool to watch them erect the T2 buildings. solid 9/10 for myself. only drawback that im not really a fan of yet is the chase distance bandits will go to kill you. but if ur an archer. not really a bad thing as they wont reset and you can continue to kite them endlessly until they are all dead or you run out of arrows. great game overall so far. and they are literally updating and fixing broken things daily. cant even be mad about bugs if theyre fixing them daily??,Recommended,Early Access Review

Minish_Mirage,12.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BakaTesting/,"April 26, 2024",0,"I bought this game not really knowing what to expect, I've been seeing bits and pieces of it since before release, and, after an hour of gameplay, I can say that I really enjoy it so far! This game is absolutely a slow-grind, it won't be for everyone, and people should understand that, at the time of this review, the game is brand new. It's still in early access, and, yes, the game has bugs and glitches, but, that's to be expected.Oddly enough though, this game is, essentially, at it's core value, something I've been looking for for years now. I haven't even gotten into the story of this game yet, but the basic gameplay mechanics and features remind me of a game that I very much used to love growing up, and something that I haven't really seen reproduced since (albeit, I'm normally not interested in this genre of gameplay). It brings back fond memories of playing Lost in Blue, from my childhood years, everything from having to hand build homes and traps piece by piece, foraging for sticks and stones to craft items and build structures from the ground up, trapping and hunting animals, having others relying on your skills for food and shelter... It brings back a lot of happy memories, and I've greatly enjoyed this game because of it so far.  I cannot speak for the game's story, as of this point, as I've not managed to get very far into it, but it seems like an interesting concept so far.Something I hope to see in this game though is a concept of consequences. I would like there to be consequences for the player's actions, consequences for your choices, things that will negatively or positively impact your gameplay and the story in different ways. This is not to say that this is or isn't already a feature in the game, at this time, I do not know, but, I would like to see it if it isn't. This seems like the perfect game for such functions, because you have to build other character's trust in order to get what you want, what you need. To have other NPCs help you, or move into your settlement. I would like to see the player's actions and words actually matter in these situations, rather than just being for roleplay purposes. I would also love to see more customization in the future. This is a medieval era style game, so, obviously nothing super flashy or out of place like bright pink hair or anything, but, other natural hair colors, different hair styles, different skin tones, things like that would be much appreciated in the future. And a personal request, if I may? Spear fishing! I have not seen a game use this style of fishing in AGES, but it was a really fun feature in the few games I have played that featured it, nothing was more thrilling than having to perfectly time your thrust in order to catch fish, or the satisfaction actually managing to land a clear shot gave.All of this aside though, sentimentality and ideas out of the way, this is a really fun game so far, and I plan to play a lot more of it (and convince my friend to join me, if I can  xD) and I do hope to watch it grow and flourish in the future. For players buying the game at this time, during early testing, please do remember that this IS early access. There will, of course, be problems that come up occasionally, this is, as of now, an unpolished product, and we must not forget that when complaining about gameplay issues or bugs and glitches. This period of development is specifically for rooting out such issues. For people who enjoy slow-grind games like this one, I absolutely recommend it, even having little experience with the game's story as of now, I've greatly enjoyed building, taking on quests, hunting and collecting materials to build with, exploring is also really nice and the game's graphics, when they work, are very nice at a high setting. This game also has a lot of voice acting, which I greatly appreciate! This game will not hold your hand through it, but, it also doesn't leave you stranded with no idea of what you're supposed to be doing. The map will tell you where you need to go to find NPC's you're supposed to interact with for quests, and the game will also help you when it comes to placing items that you're trying to build, it also indicates when prey that you're hunting can see you, which makes hunting easier to accomplish, but, it's not so easy that it's boring, or a chore to do.And most importantly... you CAN pet the cats. May I also request that we be allowed to pet the cows and goats in the future as well? Cattle also enjoy pets and cuddles, I would be overjoyed if it ever became an option to pet all of the docile animals.",Recommended,Early Access Review

Using the renown as a currency based system i.e. A expert farmer is going to take alot more renown and potentially require you to conquer the town itself before you can recruit them.

Electric Feaces,48.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/objectinanimate/,"April 25, 2024",0,"Yeah it's pretty decent, i'm enjoying it. A few bugs which is to be expected with an early access. Bit sceptical as Snail Games are involved. 7.8/10 (At the moment)The game doesn't really hold your hand which I like, the graphics are very pleasing, I'm running the game at 4k no issue frames feel good with my 3090. Enjoyable game play loop for sure especially if you're into the medieval building genre, the animations are nice and smooth, it feels good. The combat however feels a bit clunckly, like a slower, rougher version of Mount and Blade: Bannerlord, however it may just be getting used to it. I love the management system being able to set up supply lines between outposts, that's pretty juicy and meaty. There are alot of mechanics from a few different games bundled into this sweet little package. I'm digging it, could be executed better but i'm sure that will come with updates. This game has a Palworld like feel when it comes to the amalgamation. Multiple games stitched together into one to make a new enjoyable experience.One thing I really don't like is the Valheim food system in this game. The food system in Valheim works for Valheim, it doesn't really work this style of game, I want to be able to stockpile my food to last throughout winter... (Winter was only about 1 or in game days) and not have restricted Health and Stamina. Maybe a better level system as well to make it feel like i'm achieving more, I.E. less grind. Hopefully this will get balanced out in time because it is really fun.I would recommend giving it a go for sure the game is pretty immersive which I absolutely love, I'm really liking it, it defo needs more flushing out though and I guess it will be a better game for a wider audience.UPDATE: Devs seem to be updating the game every day, which I think is real good! Alot of promise and the more I play and get used to the game, the more fun I'm having. It's even better with friends!UPDATE #2: really staring to vibe with this after 30 hours, took alot of time but it now completely has me, the Co-op mode is great with friends really makes me wish you could have private servers for this game, so the game can run persistently, and you're not locked into another person's save.Things could be improved upon to make the game feel more complete,1. maybe a more simplified priority system. 2, increase skill max from 10 to 100, just so leveling up feels less grindy, the grind is huge going from 1/10, if it was from 1/100 but taking the same amount of time to get to 1/100 as it does from 1/10, the grind would be so much more satisfying.Yeah this is the one 100%, this game is giving me some real Life is Feudal: Your Own vibes for sure and throughout lockdown that game zucked mine and my boys life, this is the new LiF:YO tonnes of RP potential if you're into that sort of thing. Donkey Crew, you're missing out on a mass of audience that would kill for this niche.Donkey Crew, I know you're testing the waters and all. Please don't let this game fail, this will become my new CR4CK sniffing joy.TIPS for players: TURN FLUID BLOCKING OFF, IT WILL MAKE COMBAT MORE ENJOYABLE!",Recommended,Early Access Review

I try to resist reviewing early in the honeymoon phase, but I have seen quite a bit of unwarranted criticism that needs to be tempered with the positives.They have made solid progress since the test in 2023. It feels like there is a lot to do. They are patching daily to iron out bugs. After playing for the last two days I just looked at the map and realized I had only explored about 1/20th of it still felt big and immersive.Combat does feel weird, but I think its a design decision rather than just a poorly implemented system or the product of an inability to make something more traditional.I find it a bit of a struggle trying to manage my town, people and production, but I cannot say whether that is just a me problem or design problem at this point.Bellwright is what I hoped Medieval Dynasty would become.

However, they've been churning out a LOT of updates and patches. Relatively close to early access launch, which says so much about the people developing this. This is what fixing should look like. Game wise, it's actually pretty good. It's a bit slower paced, but a lot of people enjoy that and I do too. The archery is actually pretty neat, it's not overly easy, but it's not really hard either. It's exactly what it advertises and it actually looks really beautiful. My only concern would be frame rates can be iffy, BUT I will say, considering how fast they dish out updates and patches, I don't think this will be a concern for much longer. All in all, it's an early access game, and watching it develop will be fun. The game play itself is fun, even as it is right now.

Works quite well. Archery seems frustrating at first but it has a learning curve and proved to be quite satisfying. All and All I've had few issues. I've seen some complains about the stamina but its pretty much the same as Valheim. Better food equal better stam and health. Considering food can be gathered from dead bandits or by your villagers, it really isnt an issue, though perhaps food fades too quickly.Building: So the building is really immersive. I started off thinking building was far too quick when building tier 1 structures, but when you come to tier 2.. holy hell.. you have to build like 200 pieces bit by bit. you literally get to watch the structure get built, log by log, plank by plank. Its very cool and unique. Also quite time consuming. So chuck on a video on your other screen.. and if that's not for you. Villagers will build for you, and they seem to build much faster than you, three pieces at a time instead of one. So theres plenty to do while you wait for them to build. You can literally build anywhere that isnt a NPC villlage from my understanding. Which is great. I just wish you could build your own roads but i'm sure that feature is to come considering this is week 1 early access.Villagers: Actually probably the most useful Villagers i've seen in a game. They can gather and feed themselves in a pinch. They really get the work done while your busy and you can set priorities for each one. Fairly well made honestly. Only issue I had was not being able to assign who i want to a station and waiting ages for them to make something but, that's probably my own terrible logistics.All and all, so far it's really good. Certainly the game I waited half a year for. It really just needs polish, better art styling and some quality of life and i'm certain its coming.So if you like settlement builders that can be time consuming like Life is fuedal or Medieval dynasty, for the asking price of this game, which is quite fair, I highly recommend you pick it up. And if you are really only looking for a perfectly polished game.. well.. let it cook. come back in a year, I'm sure it will be perfect.. or abandoned but..

Issue that I'm running into presently is that the game crashes while I'm in combat.At first there was a rabbit that was on a rock, not too far from the main city that you start next to and when I killed the rabbit, the game crashed.  This happened about 5 times in total.  I would reload the saved game and then it would happen all over again.Now, when I engage the bandits, I killed the first of 2 guys.  After killing the second one, the game crashes.  This part is getting rather frustrating, but the piss poor AI voice acting aside, this is kind of a fun game to play.  I would love to see some stability come from the combat portion of the game so that I don't have to continue to fight the same bandits over and over again.P.S. - I've tried fighting different bandits, in different areas, they all work the same way.My computer is rather beefy.

This does not mean it can not improve in the hopeful near future. Despite everything I'm about to type, I enjoy this game and its idea. IN MY OPINION, here are some things I recommend in my first 4 hours playing before I gave up. (1) Crouch button/keybinding (2) Stealth (3) Make winter make sense (The ability to craft fur clothing, etc.) (4) It'd be nice if items in your inventory stacked, like wood, stone, etc. (5) More quality of life in conversations with npc's, like mouth movement, and facial expressions at the very least, characters feel very lifeless. (6) The waypoint button does not work. (7) TURN DOWN SETTLERS NEEDING FOOD EVERY FIVE MINUTES!!!! This game could be renamed to feed the people every five minutes simulator or they leave and search for food in desperation (8) The combat with the mouse movement where I swing is weird (9) Cows are weird as well, I kill them they despawn with no option to loot their remains, cows are very lifeless and weird (10) Not sure what to do with all the hide I loot (11) Bandit flag claiming is buggy (12) Everyone has a winter cloak but not me? Not able to equip winter  cloaks not in winter for looks? (13) More customization options for character creation (14) In general more life like features in NPCS and character (14) Maybe add a dodge/dash or a roll feature? (15) You can't mark any way points on the map way point is just in general buggy. (16) Better quality voice acting would be nice! (Does not mean get louder) (17) My character's body clips through clothing and so does npc's (18) My settlers just look for food during the winter, any meat or food in general I have accumulated spoils in less than 20 minutes with no in game way to preserve it. (19) Add npc icons in villages for like blacksmith, merchants, food merchants that are visible icons on the map once you enter the village first time. (20) My population workers just started recrafting torches I had dropped on the ground without me telling them too? (21) Hard to find water areas in beginning only nearby reeds are owned by village. (22) Worker filled up my camp chest as soon as I placed it down with like crafting materials I had in the workbench? (23) I sleep, I wake up, a block of text appears after I wake up that disappears before I even blink and I'd like to read it y'know? (24) Water freezes over in winter? (25) Make movements of characters more smooth/faster/realistic/better!! (26) Add a waiting feature to skip the time like in fallout? (27) ability to use furniture? (28) When eating or drinking/using items like bandages, etc. add an animation for the character!",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

Meaning they will loop back if you run to far away, hurting kiting ability. -Very slow up-take, almost got bored and shelved the game-Feels very early access with clunky controls, weird NPC pathing, and AI generated voice linesResult: 8/10 (tier 2 after 70 hours 3/10)It's an interesting game to play that really hits the niche market on it's head. However it is still pretty early in it's development to fully enjoy. Regardless, I believe the price is fair for what you get as it delivers on most aspects. Being as I'm already 10 hours in, I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface. So as patches and updates come out, it may corrupt the save. Leading me to believe that this game should be wish-listed for a year or 2 before purchasing and playing for the first time. Especially as some aspects of the game can become rather annoying or infuriating as NPC's tend to be severely lacking in a lot of regards. Or as some quests are bugged, especially those with optional parts.Update: Hit Tier #2Upon finally hitting tier 2 and setting my eyes more on those special crafters, I found a very annoying problem. That being, certain towns only have certain types of crafters. Haerndean for example seems to only have Blacksmiths, Weavers, and Farmers. This is great until you realize you need Laborers to make the raw materials such as leather to make most of the t2 gear and equipment that the weaver and blacksmith can provide.  However, once you liberate your first town, all other town brigands will become hostile to you, and for some reason way more numerous than Haerndean. Making it extremely difficult to progress and liberate other towns, therefore cutting off access to other crafters. I discovered through some exploring that the closest town to me that has Laborers is Farnworth. Yet this also has a large castle like bandit camp right ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ next to it that spams out dozens of high level bandits in chainmail. So even with late t1 gear on all 17 of my helpers, I can barely make a dent into it, let alone the 10-15 brigands who come from the town right next to it. Leaving me with just 2 options, give up, or recruit everyone I can from Haerndean and spam both the town and the castle with 20-30 helpers until both are dead enough for me to begin liberating them and doing all the bs quests. Overall losing constantly without making progress sucks. That or restart my entire run and just do quests for all the towns until i'm just about to start liberating all of them, which would suck as I already put in 70 hours to get this far. Regardless it really feels like going from t1 to t2 is just waaaaayyy to difficult for just swapping from bronze to iron/leather gear.",Recommended,Early Access Review

dunno what im doin,49.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028569624/,"April 25, 2024",0,"TL;DR: Name your character Robin Hood and enjoy bringing forth the revolution in a biome worthy of hitting that screenshot button.What a (beautiful!) survival craft gem that breaks the typical mold in my humble opinion. The game starts out pretty tedious and familiar to fans of survival craft games but quickly stands out. Games in this genre are typically lacking in story, but in my first couple hours a standout villager pitches regicide at me and has generally made me invested in progressing the story. You are the protagonist seeking to right a wrong/seek revenge. Villages feel alive (pretty unique for survival craft), although they need to work on npc spawn and despawn lol (I just talked to you behind me beggar man!). You can build and control an army. Deceptively large tech tree (doesn't seem so at first). Village management ala rimworld and similar. The static map might challenge replayability (not sure) but the open world is huge for your character's travel abilities (not sure if theres fast travel). Complex reputation system (renown and individual village reputation combined with individual villager recruitment requirements). I've not yet played Medieval Dynasty I see referenced in the comments, but if you ever wanted to feel like what its like to start Robin Hood Industries from the ground up this game is for you! This game feels like a really good mix of survival craft and adventure game and I have really enjoyed it so far, I think it lands perfectly. The graphics in this game (if your paddleboat gaming rig can handle it - my i9 intel 4070rtx laptop does just fine but definitely gets the fans blowing) - are chef's kiss - night actually feels like IRL night (hello normal sized moon), mornings and sunsets are beautiful. The weather feels legit. The forest (for those of you who have been in one) feels real, and has the right amount of life (love you RDR2 but the forests are too alive in that game). All in all I'm pretty sure I will be playing this game for a while, regardless of any further love put into the game, great job devs!Last note: No bugs so far for me.",Recommended,Early Access Review

I do not care about previous games this dev  has.  This review is for Bellwright.  Early access has been taken into consideration and this review is for the state of the game now.1) The game is made in UE4 but the character models are way outdated and ugly for UE4.2) Super limited inventory space.  One of the worse I've seen.  Every item picked up takes an inventory space.  Pick up 6 lavender flowers required for a build?  That will take 6 of the 24 spaces allotted for inventory.  6 flowers takes up 6 slots just as 6 tree logs take up 6.  FAR too much time spent running back and forth to my storage box that is equally ridiculous with the same silly restrictions.3) The game needs 1st person view option and not just 3rd person.  4) Overall combat is janky and blah.I suggest waiting, at least, another 1-2 years before checking back on this game.  I hope it improves.  I wish the devs would stop with the restrictive inventory nonsense.  It's a bane in most survival/build games.",Not Recommended,Early Access Review

The crafting system is well-balanced, offering a variety of items to create without being overly complex.However, the combat system falls short. The controls feel clunky, and enemy encounters often turn into frustrating swarms. You'll find yourself surrounded by enemies with very little chance to defend yourself.  Archery, which could be a strategic option, feels practically useless. It takes so long to draw your bow and shoot that melee combat becomes the only viable option in most situations.If the developers can polish the combat, especially by making archery more responsive and giving players a better chance against groups of enemies, Bellwright could truly shine.Despite the combat issues, I still recommend Bellwright for players who enjoy RPGs with a medieval open world, offering crafting and exploration.

The hunter that teaches you traps focused on the research bench but there was no way to get the other 2 people to use the other benches even when I had the material.

Great stuff, and its only going to get better. A lot of things that I have never seen in other games like this. Fact is I read other reviews and well I have never crashed, I have not had any failures for quests, and in the 2.6 hours I have played its been constant things going on. I had to make myself get off the game to go to bed. Its really good.  The fact that this is EA even gives me more hope. I have ran out of things to do in 2 hours on some EA games, but no this is going to be awhile.Update after 30 hours. Game is really getting good and Im just scratching the surface. Devs are releasing things daily and its like they read my mind. Its such a great feeling of accomplishments in the game, when you reach a level of your town. I have been in raids, I have had narrow escapes. Its just a game of always something going on. Cant say enough. People need to get it.Ok, man, I would say Im about 80 hours in, and again, just amazing. I am so addicted I cant stop. Made some outlets and it was so fun to get it right. Now with the added feature of having your people go get food before a raid, its just over the top great. I have read some reviews and it literally sounds like they either didnt play the game or didnt know how to do things. Had one person bashing the game saying they had to take on bandits 3 on 1. Do they even know you can have a crew walk around with you? Anyway, if you dont like this game you dont like games like this, thats all I have to say. I wish there was a higher rating I could give it. Update, over 100 hours it seems at this point. Gets better and better. I have had zero point zero issues with crashing or anything close to that, not sure why the people that are crashing, but I have not had that one in 100 hours at least. Everything is just so good, I always always have things to do, and I dont even feel like Im scratching the surface. I read some of these reviews and it cracks me up. I have read, why do my people keep putting x in storage...There is literally every way possible to make this not happen, you literally control every aspect. I think some people cant do something right off and they lose patience and dont bother to find out how. I have not had a game grab me and hang on like this.Man am I really that many hours. Ok, I have read some reviews about crashing. I have to ask, what the hell are you running this on. I have not crashed once. I think I almost did once way early on, but its the most stable EA game I have ever played, so I would say you have some major driver issues or you are just running some POS computer. Also, this game is still getting better after over 200 hours, its quite remarkable, have never played an EA game this advanced. Unreal.Ok, my last review update. Up to 310 hours, ever update they do is amazing. I am trying to find something to fault, maybe addiction....anyway.

One that is making my mind melt is the tech system they have in place. Many of the tier one tech requires a resource you can only craft in tier 2. Not only that but the tier 2 main upgrade requires this material. Only way I can get my hands on so far with the time I have played is to ether buy it or be lucky as hell with a box.  I have not seen as many AI problems as others have so far except in combat (My best solder hid in a hut while me and 2 week villagers got destroyed in a raid).I do think the food system needs to be fixed. My recommendations is that food helps healing and does not effect max hp cap. Stamina I think should be effected still but the HP effects of food hurt so much in combat if it runs out. So HP regen is faster than before but it doesn't effect max HP. If they want it to effect max HP make a hunger system not a food system, the difference is very big in the end!Lots of promise if the devs actually care about the project.

For an Early Access game it has so much content, enough for 70+ hours of gameplay... and a lot of replayability. Co-op is very stable (no lags or performance issues so far), and most issues and bugs are patched very quickly by the dev team who is actively listening to feedback from the player base. It's clear a ton of work has been put into the game, and the dev team seems to be committed to carry on improving the game and adding more to it (horses!). The combat takes some getting used to for people (like me) who aren't used to directional combat, but it makes it challenging in a satisfying way - raids also give players a nice challenge!

I just finished building my first village hall, which in some ways feels like the actual beginning of the game based on what I'm hearing in the community.Updated Likes:-This game is pretty chill, and feels like a slow burn without being boring.  If I'm waiting for my followers to finish some large backlog of tasks I've given them I can either pitch in, or go questing/raiding/hunting/etc.-I haven't yet experienced co-op play, but I'm looking forward to it.  Feels like a friend or two would add a whole new dimension.-Archery is quite fun.  It's still fully third-person (as others have mentioned, first person would be DOPE), but both combat and hunting feel challenging without being frustrating.  Judging distance and arrow drop and nailing a deer or bandit in the head from outside their awareness is pretty rewarding.  It's also kinda fun to cheese the AI by jumping back and forth over low walls as they pursue all the way around and get shot in the face.-Dev team seems to be learning from the difficulties of their previous games.  They're very communicative, and thus far we've even had daily bug patches.  Gives more confidence in longevity of the game.Updated Dislikes:-Speaking of combat, I still just can't get in to the melee mechanics.  I've watched videos, read tutorials, and spent a bunch of time trying to get it right, and I still feel like it's designed for an overwhelmingly small niche of players.  Devs say ""Footwork is key"", but basically all I do is walk backwards blindly, dodging attacks, until I'm miles from where I started and the bandits have given up their attempt to kill me.  Any attempt to engage inevitably ends in death, especially if they're shielded (even if I am as well).-Town mechanics are sometimes baffling.  Camp followers will seemly work on things that are specifically set to low priority, which results in a bit too much micro-managing to get things done how I want them.  Other things, like farms, are pretty painful to work with.  I'd love to set a crop priority and a max amount that I need on hand and let my followers plant the highest priority crop that's under the limit.  What actually happened was that I set flax at 200 max in my storage, and when I hit that the farmers wouldn't pick what they had already planted, leaving me to manually pick and destroy all the extra crops they planted.  (Oh, and there's no bulk pick option.  Some nodes had 20 flax in them, and I had to click-wait-click to pick up every single one individually.)Hopefully some of QOL changes are on the horizon so I can comfortably build my booming metropolis without getting bogged down with overwhelming minutiae.Ready to go kick some more bandit butt!Original Review:One hour in!  Recommending as of now based on my ""fun ratio"" of ""hours played / $ spent"". If I am on track to hit my baseline of 1, I'll give it a thumbs up, but if I get bored or disenchanted before I hit the 1 mark I'll update to a thumbs down.  That means I only need 27 hours of good fun!Likes: Premise/genre.  I've been dying for an RPG city builder in which you actually get to act and level up as a citizen leader and not an ethereal overlord.  It would be my dream to go from single hovel to towering castle (I'm doubting this game goes that far, but we'll see)Graphics.  Admittedly I have a decent graphics card, but I haven't seen any of the stuttering FPS drops or anything that others have reported.  The world isn't the absolute best I've seen, but it's not bad.Building. It's kinda fun to take an active hand in building, but I could see this getting tedious if the AI turns out to be clunky as the settlement grows.Dislikes:The combat system is, quite frankly, astoundingly uncomfortable.  Other reviews do better at explaining, so I won't try other than to say I spent a good 5 minutes straight practicing swinging my axe around like a drunkard just trying to get it to swing the direction I want and hit an immobile tree stump.  Overall successful hit rate: about 8%.  Died to a pair of brigands the second I woke up from sleep because they jumped me as I was walking out of my tent (and see my dead companion lying in front of his from the corner of my eye).  I got about one attempted swing in.Whelp, that's it for my 1 hour review.  I'll be updating this as I get further in.",Recommended,Early Access Review

I am impressed with the quality of life choices the devs made, things like materials automatically being counted in all all chests in your town and workers knowing to move from one station to another to get things made.

Even tho the tech tree etc likely is far from finished, There is plenty to be researched for both equipment and settlement.The story / lore seems to be very simple and is just a driving mechanic for progressing character and settlement development.Some quests need an amount of days to pass with the previous quest completed before it becomes available, giving you time to focus on other side quests to increase renown and reputation.Management is great. Once you get to understand the mechanics you can really see your settlement taking shape. It's a bit of a grind but once you have your third follower things start to come more easily.Cons:One Bug - When followers get hungry and start looking for food. They got stuck in the same spot but i think for some reason this is to do with the location of my settlement being next to a lot of built up area and structure debris etc. - this was a non issue once i learned how to manage the settlement properly so supplies don't run low.LONG Load screen. makes reloading previous saves an absolute bore.Combat has fine in principle, its a bit slow and needs a lot of work. Stamina is literally non existent so they need to patch this or add mounts BUT i do like how the different types of food and consuming different combinations of food effects your stamina and max health.EDIT:Price - i agree it is a little steep for what you get currently but if you purchase now, it will be well worth it as i expect the price to nearly double in a year / on full release.The negative reviews are mostly just people hating on the developer for abandoning their previous game.",Recommended,Early Access Review

There has been very few EA sandbox games that release with such love put into them.  I do think there is a long way to go for it to feel more rounded.

Still very enjoyable. Questing is a bit boring but overall 5/5.About 20 Hours in... Colony now 6 rag tag badasses kicking teeth in for me. This game is awesome and hunting and fishing is fun. Well worth the $29.99About 10 hours in. Built a small rag tag group of incompetent farmers that barely can speak let alone do anything useful. That said we somehow managed to build a logging farm, a mining hall, a few stick huts and the equivalent of a minor community.After 3 or 4 bandit attacks I have lost a few lives only to rebuild and do it all over again. Archery is somewhat unreliable for bandit hunting but fantastic for small game. Very difficult for deer hunting. A bag is a must and since I recently crafted one within my community I feel I have earned the right to give a update to this review. Pros So Far...- Building your base while slow is rewarding.- Choosing a logical base location is a really decent idea. - Challenges and quests can be somewhat tricky. But rewarding.- Nothing extremely negative so far, the weather effects are not bothersome. Cons So far...- You get jumped by 3 guys wearing armor and swords, you some how miraculously win. They drop coins and a few pieces of food. What about the bloody swords and armor? Loot drops need fixing.- OK Chop chop chop chop is a bit boring, but so is not having a sled to carry huge hauls. - Females don't join your band unless you build trust but all the beggars are dudes.

Dankius Maximus,22.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/crazywolf5150/,"April 23, 2024",0,"TLDR:Yes, it's very much in early access with some bugs, yes, it could use some QoL improvements for inventory management, yes, the voice-acting of the NPCs are AI and noticeably so. Yes, it was made by the same people who made Last Oasis, which also has mixed reviews and was declared ""abandoned."" However, I really enjoyed Last Oasis for the time that I played and it was worth the money to me. My only problem with that game and what ultimately made me quit playing was how frustratingly unbalanced the PvP was if you didn't have a large crew to roll with. This game doesn't have as interesting of a setting, but it won't have that problem, still keeps the good combat and plays like a 3rd person open-survival craft version of Manor Lords, which sounds awesome to me and this will keep me satisfied until I finally get my hands on that and likely more so later when I come back to it after many updates. Regardless of a few minor issues, it's still far better than any AAA game released in the past several years for half the price.The Good:RPG mechanics are similar to Valheim, where you level up skills by doing them, which I find to be an awesome idea and would love to see more games implement this. Food also works the same way as Valheim, where you don't need it to live, but it gives you buffs to health and stamina, which is often very much needed to play effectively.The Bad:You can demolish structures, but you aren't refunded any of the building material used to craft them, which almost defeats the purpose of demolishing an old settlement to move elsewhere. You will spend a good deal of time walking and running and there are no mounts yet, so I do hope they add horses to this.The Ugly:The combat is quite difficult early on, which can be viewed as good or bad, depending on how  much you like to be challenged or how sadomasochistic you are. Certain resources can also get scarce and it can be a grind, but it's at least fun in the process of grinding.",Recommended,Early Access Review

It will resonate with many people as it taps into many genres simultaneously, but as such, it might be easy for some to not realize the depth at first.  This is a settlement management game... some compare it to Medieval Dynasty, but in some ways its also a bit like Rimworld 3d.  You have to manage and prioritize tasks... you automate production lines to make sure everyone is fed, clothed, and happy... or else they are ineffective and could leave you at very inopportune times.  Yes, like others have said the combat is like Mount and Blade both in the direct combats as well as management of squads. The benefits of food / cooking and such are similar to Valheim, and maybe even more varied and robust than just linear increases.  There are a lot of elements here from various other genres and on day 2-3 since release I can already see some of the early bugs being ironed out.  Does it have a glitch or a crash here or there?  Yes, but the vision for this game is brilliant.  There is a bit of a learning curve to grasp all of these interactive systems, but as you start to see what can be done, it all just clicks.  I understand reluctance to buy Early Access as I have been burned by it numerous times in the past... but I can say, this is very much worth watching.   If the Devs continue to be responsive and listen to the player base as they have been on the discord so far... then this game holds promise to be enjoyable across a wide breadth of genres.  ...................................................................................................................................................    [Original]  Really good so far...  Yeah the random NPCs have AI voices, but they have a disclaimer about that and changing it in the future.  But it comes down to a matter of if you feel you can trust them to hold up to that.  I understand that some of the negative reviews are stemming from past experiences with the company and their other games.... to that I don't know. It looks really good... the sound track is immersive and solid.  It plays well even on older specs.  Combat is a little weird but some base mechanics are in place that seem to indicate it could be improved with some minor adjustment.  I'm cautiously optimistic.  Their track record is a little concerning, but what I can say is that I'm currently enjoying the game.  I'm also on the discord server for this game and it seems the devs have been really participatory and active.

So it was a must buy, because its exactly what i have been looking for.Since ppl got 3 ""major"" complaints, i am going to break these down first.1. Optimation complaints: I have no idea where those are coming from. Sure, the game is not 100% optimised, but it runs absolutely fine on my system (which i would rate mid tier).2. Graphics complaints: Again i got no clue, what ppl are complaining about here. Ya it aint AAA graphics, but their absolutely okay! And if you are somebody who thinks graphics > content, then all i can say is: You poor poor poor soul... :P3. AI generated voices complaints: They aint bad. They are planning to change those at some point, but tbh they just shouldnt waste any resources on that. This isnt a full RPG. Sure there is questing, but it just isnt the focus. I do not understand complaints about that either!Those have been the major complaints of ppl, which are just laughable imho.Now im going to talk about the game and my experience in about 6 hours with it.1. The start (might call it tutorial): It is a bit boring, but most tutorials are, no? Everything seems slow and boring first 1-2 hours, but it is getting better and better, once you get more people who are doing the ""boring things"" for you.2. Bugs, Crashes, general performance: I had no crash, i did not run into any major bug, i got no stuttering or anything. Only thing that takes a bit too long for my taste, is loading into the game.3. Content, and some general things: Content wise, i can not tell how many hours you can get out of this game yet. I have only 3 followers after my playtime, am nowhere near ready to free the villages or anything. The technology tree tells me i researched about 15% of what is available to research/build right now. You might be able to go faster than me, im not rushing.The biggest issue i got with the game, is QOL. I can think of a lot quality of life improvements here. Some things are annoying, but also can easily be changed. There is a reason it is early access, and if you expect a perfect game, you shouldnt be buying EA games anyway.My opinion about this game: Its great. I can see myself easily getting enough playtime out of it to be worth the price tag (which is low imho). So, if you are worrried about the game being finished, ask yourself is it worth the money at its current state. Thats exactly the question you should ask yourself before buying ANY EA game. For me its clearly a HELL YEAH, it is! Highly recommended, i love it.",Recommended,Early Access Review

I personally would rather get resources from the towns after you liberate them that was its less of a grind instead of having them soul perpose wise to be for the acheivement and unlocking recruitable AI with traits. The combat just becomes a numbers game and its really grindy solo to have to remake all the weapons/shields over and over its not like it really adds anything to the game by them having durability but meanwhile bows dont have durability so ??? Alot of spots on the map where the ai on companion mode straight up just wont follow you because of pathing BUGS. A large and i do mean LARGE portion of the map just is baron and unaccessable which really makes me question what the fun part of the game will really be other then fighting the same bandit/brigand AI over and over. Also theres a point for the 3rd city liberation that it sends 40 plus ai at you and around that stage its common to have 10-16 MAX recruited AI unless you just take flat junk stats ones which dont really help you all that much. If you have the money to blow on a very early access game id say hold off for now unless you have a duo partner to chat and game with. update the devs dont post constant updates anymore which is what happend to last oasis(same company produced this game). Would hold off till the polish this up more.,Not Recommended,Early Access Review
